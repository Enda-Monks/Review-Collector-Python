Although it's composed with some of Bjork's most signature sounds, most commonly her use of experimental electronica and scat singing, Vespertine favors more minimal yet ethereal effects to accompany the very, very sexual -- or rather, sensual -- feel in its lyricism and most importantly, Bjork's breathy vocal delivery on every track.\r The highlights: \"Pagan Poetry\" has one of the most memorable melodies -- and most, ahem, NSFW music videos -- of the '00s, which has Bjork writing some of her most deliciously dark and desperate lyrics to the accompaniment of Asian teahouse-esque melodies, music boxes, harps, and Bjork's extraordinarily emotional and equally powerful vocals. The mood throughout the duration of Vespertine typically remains as melancholy as it is wintery (\"Frosti\" is a one-minute instrumental interlude that tributes the snowy season through and through to the crossfading sample of footsteps in the snow at the beginning of \"Aurora\"). \"Cocoon\" is one of the most minimal moments on the album, choosing suggestive and seductive whispers to lure the listener into a momentary coma, while \"An Echo, A Stain\" is its darkest; the distorted bleeps, bloops, mumbles, and choir vocals are something you'd expect to hear on an early Evanescence record.\r Bjork might be more memorable for her early-'90s house music and her swan dress in the early-'00s, but Vespertine is a testiment to just how important she truly is in a music industry where \"artists\" cannibalize on each other's ideas instead of cooking up their own material. I'd go as far as to call Vespertine the greatest album since Bjork started her solo career in music, but I'd call it one of the greatest, most grandiose albums I've ever heard in my life. Then again, I was born in 1993 and grew up on Bjork's '00s material, but that doesn't mean I don't stand by that sentiment.\u2026 Expand",

While the record unravels, we can see a pattern of minimal daily sounds that were boosted to give melodies to each song. This album sounds winter-ish and quite \"domestic\". It gives a \"home\" feeling, which I can relate to Bj\u00f6rk's homeland, the exquisite and cold Iceland. It talks about the most variate of subjects, from (lots of) sex, family care, snow, winter in general, and even losing keys (B-Side \"Domestika\"). It all starts with \"Hidden Place\", a song that talks metaphorically about sex, love, and sort of a shelter. It samples classic music and shows some really out of this world instrumentals, that feature sounds from full choirs to shuffling cards. \"Cocoon\" is another one that talks about shelter, about home in a sort of way, on the way of finding home in someone else, specifically on the warmth of a kiss between two lovers standing on a melting iceberg. \"It's Not Up To You\" shows quite the concept of the album: the song is about a day at home, \"how to master the perfect day\", and how to get whatever the narrator is longing so much for. \"Undo\" is a jewel. The songwriting and the choir wraps it into a shell of exquisiteness. \"Pagan Poetry\" is the best song on the album. The crude emotions on Bjork's voice, the lyrics, the strings arrangement, her high notes, everything makes it one-of-a-kind. The song is purely about sex, extremely metaphorical.  \"Frosti\" is a instrumental, but sounds like heaven. The melody could only be made by Bjork's skills. It's a great introduction to one of the gems of the album, \"Aurora\". The melody and the progressions makes it stand at the top 10 of her best songs ever. It features sounds from ice being smashed. \"An Echo, A Stain\" is quiet and minimalist, and need to be taken attention for one to like it. \"Sun in My Mouth\" has lyrics borrowed from E. E. Cummings' poem \"I Will Wade Out\" and it's one of the highlights from the album. The arrangement and her voice makes it sound somewhat ethereal. It should be longer. \"Heirloom\" has the whole instrumental sampled from \"Crabcraft\" by Console, and it talks about how her family takes care of her when she's sick. It has oniric lyrics and envolving melodies. \"Harm of Will\" has co-writing from the director Harmony Korine, and is another highlight. Divided in several parts, it puts Bjork's voice in evidence and can make one very emotional. \"Unison\" wraps the record with a 6-minute envolving track that is a favourite amongst several fans. It closes the album with hability only Bjork could pull out. \"Generous Palmstroke\" is a bonus track that should have been included on the full album. It features only Bjork's voice and a harp played with sheer talent. This album is absolutely amazing.\u2026 Expand",

As m\u00fasicas que o abrem j\u00e1 te poem nas nuvens e mostram os sentimentos amorosos profundos de Bj\u00f6rk, \"Hidden Place\" e \"Cocoon\" com sua sexualidade expl\u00edcita. O ponto alto do \u00e1lbum - na minha humilde opini\u00e3o - \u00e9 \"Pagan Poetry\", que me prende todas as vezes que ou\u00e7o devido \u00e0 sua letra enigm\u00e1tica e batidas hipn\u00f3ticas e sua transi\u00e7\u00e3o deliciosa para \"Frosti\" - que apesar de instrumental \u00e9 uma m\u00fasica muito interessante - e ent\u00e3o \"Aurora\", que nos faz relaxar ap\u00f3s a explos\u00e3o de emo\u00e7\u00f5es das m\u00fasicas anteriores. A letra de \"Sun In My Mouth\", composta por um poema de E. E.

Mas, apesar de ter sido o foco nesse review, sexo \u00e9 apenas um dos temas apresentados no \u00e1lbum, h\u00e1 outros que talvez se sobreponham, al\u00e9m das diversas maneiras de interpretar suas letras.

And it kind of is, which is one of it's few downfalls. It is so nice to hear something exuberant (aside from the calm ones of course) after the beautiful sweeping Vespertine and experimental vocal Medulla. Volta kicks off with a jungle-inspired, fun track, called \"Earth Intruders.\" This is one of the better songs on the album, and I was dancing around when I heard it, but then the 1 minute+ brass outro, while pretty, completely through me off. And so begins the 8-track downfall. the tracks are all fine, but I dislike how they are all strung together by little nature sounds. It's kind of sweet at first, then you realize \"wait... if I want to just listen to one song, I'll get this annoying, unmatching outro.\" And if theyre not strung together in a way, they end PRECISELY when the next one starts. This works well once (\"Dull Fame\" to \"Innocence\") but overall this stringing bothers me. \"Wanderlust\" and \"Innocence\" are two of my favorites, and the former may rank among her best songs ever. \"Dull Flame of Desire\" is beautiful, but I will only listen to it's 7.5-minute structure sometimes when I listen to the album as a whole. From \"I See Who You Are\" and \"Pneumonia,\" Volta takes a bit of a slowdown, losing some melodic power. These songs are very beautifully crafted though, which makes up for it's bridging. The song I dislike highly is \"Hope.\" It has a terribly trying-too-hard-to-be-political scheme about it (\"What's the lesser of two evils, if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant, hits her target or not?\") I think it's the worst line on the album. But, then we're saved, by one of the best tracks I've ever heard, \"Declare Independence.\" An industrial-sounding, powerful shouting song where it's repetition works in it's favor. The album closes with the \"okay\" song \"My Juvenile.\" It's nice, but I don't love it as much as the others. Overall, Volta is not her best album, by FAR. But it's a nice sign that Bjork is not settling down any time soon, and she'll be back with something different (as always) in a few years.\u2026 Expand",

I hope she sits down and really hashes out some great music for the next album. Volta is so not worthy of her legacy. But maybe she needed to make this album to cleanse her musical palate. I guess every artist is entitled to one lemon.\u2026 Expand",

There are allusions to all her previous albums, but an attempt at taking the best of those works and putting them in a blender merely offers a schizophrenic record with little melody. Marketed as a dancable, \"fun\" album, especially with the Timbaland, only the first single \"Earth Intruders\" lives up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, \"Volta\" is a good album, but it makes no leap forward for such a progressive artist and requires a few spins for its best moments to take hold.\u2026 Expand",

It's actually difficult to listen to some of the songs on this album, however, even for a long-time Bjork fan like myself. To be precise, this album feels a lot like an unfinished re-release of some of her older works: \"Hope\", for instance, is \"Cocoon\"-esque; \"Wanderlust\", for instance, is \"All Neon Like\"-esque. With that said, they are both fairly good tracks, although neither of them feel new. The same stands for a few other tracks on the album. The other 50% of the album is more or less a waste of time, especially the tracks which feature one of the most disgusting/creepy vocalists I've ever heard, \"Antony Hegarty\". He does Bjork's lead vocals no justice. If you're *really* curious about this album, just buy it used, because I'm sure many of them will be returning to the shelves soon enough.\u2026 Expand",

Bjork contribution to pop & avant garde in the last 15 years has been among the most interesting stories of that time. No artist has more deftly balanced fearless adventureousness with consistantcy. An artist like Bjork you'd assume would have by now discovered the dark side of following every fanciful whim, producing a turkey or two. Yet looking back over her catelog each of her proper studio releases and both of her soundtracks has its own soul, statement & meaningful contribution as a definative chapter to Bjorks legacy and gift to the world. This record is no different. It takes time to hear it (it took me about 15 spins) but just about everything you've ever loved about a past Bjork release is on this record. Admittedly, some of the child-like exhuberance that used to light up a room has been dulled by the weight of our times. It burns still but feels labored like she has to work at keeping it lit. That aside, who Bjork is to us - planet earths finest offering of avante garde melded with pop music, is better defined on this record than anything previously. Both houses are represented here equally only its avante garde who opens the door first this time around. If this surprises you read the extensive guest artist list for Volta. Aside from Timbaland the most mainstrean contributor is the Tazmanian who flails & kicks behind the kit for Lightning Bolt. Any grumblings you've heard are merely due to the fact there are more pop fans who listen to Bjork than avant garde ones and pop fans are lazy and don't want to put in the work. To be a Bjork fan though is to enjoy the work - to enjoy the embrace of wonder, release the attachment of expectation and letting Bjork guide you to its Volta's purpose. Your beloved ice-pixie has not forsaken you with Volta. Its her most challenging, rewarding album yet.\u2026 Expand",

The album from start to finish has a clear, crisp sound, differing from their previous style of long progressions of semi-melachonic chordal structures. From the Napoleon-esque 'Lost!', to the eastern styled 'Yes', and to the euphoric ending, 'Death & All His Friends', this is truly a remarkable album, resonating so many themes of war, love, beauty, death, hatred, faith and hope. The album itself resembles the cyclic year of seasons, with the 'Summer' songs like 'Yes' and 'Lost' contrasting with the 'Winter' songs 'Violet Hill' and 'Cemeteries of London', but perhaps the best thing about the album's structure is it's consistency, and never ending cycle of music as the last song, 'Death & All His Friends', links to album's begining, 'Life in Technicolour', in a beautiful fashion. Coldplay have really outdone themselves this time - there may not be your crowd pleasers like 'Fix You' and 'Yellow', but the album itself is solid proof that even in the 21st century there is still beauty in music, and most importantly a meaning behind the song. Absolutely, without a doubt, their best album so far.\u2026 Expand",

These reasons cause them to have the worst reputation in the world of music asides from Nickelback of course, but the Canadians is a whole different story and well deserved.\r So it was in 2009 when I bought the album. I've only heard Viva La Vida on the radio, but everytime I heard it, it was only portions of it. At that time I was more of an Oasis fan, and hearing Coldplay getting overplayed and getting all the grammys created a slight of jealousy and bitterness in me towards them. I was starting to jump on the bandwagon of Coldplay hate, but thank goodness out of the nowhere I decided to give Viva La Vida a try.\r Lol, my brain was hooked right at the first listen. This might not be better than AROBTH (as far as acclaim from music critics), but in my opinion, Viva is equal and sometimes sounds better. The freshness of the sound is what makes the album to stand out from its preceed. I can hear the influences of U2 in songs like Lovers In Japan or the wooah's in several of the other tracks, but the atmosphere of the sound feels so unique. Throughout the album, you find orchestra with echo sound/noise in the background, the church organs, and all these oriental instruments that bond the songs perfectly like a family where each track is related to each other. Moreover, the songs don't feel overproduced and long like in x&y, which makes the album so pleasent to listen from beginning to end.\r Coldplay also managed to incorporate the melancholy for which they are known for (mostly mocked for). Hear songs like \"Lost!' or the ballad, \"Strawberry Swing\". These are alongside Viva La Vida, the best highlights of the album. \"Lost!\" in particular, is the one that stands out. The church organ with the hip-hop-like beat is difficult to not like just as it drops at the beginning of the song, and then comes Chris Martin with the line: \"just because I'm losing, doesn't mean I'm lost\" in a melancholic tone, turning the melody even more irresistible. So, irresistible that made me think and ask myself, \"so why they hate Coldplay again?\". I was this close to jump on the bandwagon, but this album made me a fan of their music again. I already was a fan, and thanks to them I discover new bands like Oasis, Blur, Radiohead, U2, The Verve, among others. Basically I got into real music when I discovered Coldplay.\r Well I told my story and my more importantly my OPINION on this album JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MUSIC CRITIC, and my intentions are not to make you a coldplay fan, but at least to make you ponder the next time you type comments like: \"You know how I know you're gay?\", .\"Pitchfork said that...\", \"They are the water down version of ___\" which are pretentious attempts to discredit the band.\u2026 Expand",

Coldplay has crafted a wholesome album that sounds uniform yet entirely unique from their previous sound.What each listener gets is not just a good collection but a musical journey that sonically varies from song to song creating a beautiful experience. There's no real tale because the concept is to take one on an adventure. Chris Martin probably has poured himself out the most on this album, spinning tales of war, love, and pain. On the title track, Martin describes himself as a king in his past life over a background that sounds like the theme music for the appearance of a celestial body. Violet Hill features shredding guitar riffs against the piano and Martin's megaphone-like verses.But even some of those verses really stop Viva La Vida from becoming a classic. As much as the sound is sonic majesty, Chris Martin seems at a loss for words and at times weak against the superior background. His topical interests are as Paste Magazine says it, vague.Take out all of that and you have one of the greatest 47-minute musical experiences of a lifetime. However, there is no doubt that Viva La Vida is far away from becoming the definitive Coldplay album.\u2026 Expand",

The results elevate them to the level of the likes of their heroes U2. The songs are strong throughout, the production is top class without being suffocating as it was on X&Y and on some of the material the band have released since. The ideas that are explored are genuinely exciting. This record reignited my interest in Coldplay and proved, as U2 have time and time again, that just because your songs are really radio friendly doesn't mean your not a credible artist. Superb effort.\u2026 Expand",

(Original), 42, Lovers In Japan (first track), Viva La Vida, Violet Hill, Strawberry Swing, The Escapist, Glass of Water, and Rainy Day.\u2026 Expand",

'Cemeteries of London' and 'Lost!' are both songs that are just mediocre too me, not bad, just ok. I love the haunting chorus on '42', other than that most of the song is just mediocre. 'Lovers in Japan' Is a 2 part song, both parts are very good, but I probably like the first part only a little better. 'Yes' has some good parts of the song, but of 75% the time it's just a little boring, I think. It's also a 2 part song, and I prefer the 2nd part a little bit more too the first. 'Viva La Vida' is very strong in the vocal, instrument, and lyric department. It's a song that fits perfectly with the albums theme. 'Violet Hill' is quite unique compared too the other songs on the album, which to be honest applies too a lot of other songs on this album, it's just that this one is especially unique. It's a great song. 'Strawberry Swing' is a beautiful track, a song that gets you into your emotions. I feel like it would've been a good final track on the album, but 'Death and All His Friends' had the honour of that roll, which is just another mediocre song on the album, so I don't know if I can say it fits all that well at the end. overall, this album has a lot of amazing songs, but there are also a few meh songs on the album, which none of them are really bad, if I had too choose the worst song on this album it'd probably be 'Death and All His Friends' but that doesn't mean it's a terrible song. The 2nd half of the album is stronger than the 1st half admittedly, if the whole album was like the 2nd half then the record may have gotten an 8 from me. My Top 3 Favourite tracks were: Viva La Vida, Violet Hill, and Strawberry Swing...which are coincidentally all next too each other in order when you listen too them haha.\u2026 Expand",

The only song you can honestly become Manson-Orgy confused on would be the awesomely dark \"Dizzy\" on \"Candyass\". Anything else is just saying \"Jay Gordon sounds like Barry White coz his voice is deep\"...extreme, yes, but so are the lame comparisons-half of you couldn't name five Manson songs, how could you know? Orgy is not riding Korns wave either. Korn sounds much harder. Your reasoning here simply lies in the fact of labels. Big deal, ok? I give it to you, I think Vapor Transmission wasn't the best thing out of Orgy, but there was a deep point to each candycoated lyric. If any of you reviewers knew a thing about music you would know not everyone speaks as up front as Aaron Lewis from Staind. Some people actually leave interpretation as a part of their music. So I come to my point...\"Faces\" their lastest song, featured on the \"ZOOLANDER\" movie soundtrack brings back that \"Candyass\" sound which attracted me to them. Buy it and kiss their Asses. They rocked it out. While you sit and make pennies for your words, they rock out and make millions. Who's laughing now??\u2026 Expand",

And yes, I am a real metal head, I listen to all the good thrash bands so don't say I'm a poser fools. Pulse of the Maggots and Three Nil have some awesome percussion and guitar, Vermillion is a two part song that is really awesome, having weird sound effects and Corey's insane vocals. The songs Duality and Before I Forget are the two songs most commonly heard on the radio, but they are still pretty awesome, if not a little formulaic. (More so Before I Forget then Duality, I like Duality quite a bit.) So what are the songs I didn't like? Well I don't care that they went into Acoustic Guitar, but the songs The Virus of Life, Circle, and Danger-Keep Away are all very slow non Slipknot sounding songs and they just don't click with me, I couldn't listen to Danger Keep Away very long, because of the inane whispering as well haha. The song Welcome is pretty good as well I forgot to mention, and Opium of the People is awesome but needs to be longer, too short with those awesome guitar riffs.\u2026 Expand",

As someone who hates mainstream radio with passion and who owns some of the most extreme records ever peformed by humans, let me just go ahead and set the record straight: the notion that this record is soft or angling for better sales or any of that is collossal horseshit. In a perfect world, fans would realize that stretching you creative muscles or trying to grow beyond your genre is not \"selling out\", a term I doubt most of its many young users even know the true meaning of. It's supposed to be about the music, PERIOD - not radio station is playing it, or how many times the video is being played on MTV, etc. Form your own opinion. Listen to the music. And friends, let me tell you, the music here is frequently astonishing, teeming with skill and an unabashed desire to please. \"The Blister Exists\" and \"Three Nil\", which come right off the bat, are easily two of the band's best songs ever, and things don't slow down much from there. When they do get slow (yes, there are some ballads), it feels not all like a stunt or ploy, for the results are polished and catchy enough to sell the band's intentions behind them wholeheartedly. This is music made by a band that wants to GROW, not stay planted in their idols' shadows forever. Ferocious, addictive, blunt, and even funny, Vol. 3 is a messy triumph that rides over its two or three weaks tracks like a speeding train. Stay in IOWA if you wish, but for the adverturous, Vol. 3 is a great place to be.\u2026 Expand",

It overall feels like a much more mature work from the band, so parents might not be so horrified with their out-of-place feeling teenagers listening to it.\r That's not to say they're Slipknot's only audience. In fact the band's work has always had the potential for a much wider audience than it already has, but that would require people to get over the stereotypes associated with this kind of music. This album does a lot to help that.\r Not only is the style and tone different than previous albums, but the lyrical themes are as well. The stuff can get pretty dark. Songs like The Nameless, The Virus of Life, and the Vermillion tracks focus on darker aspects of \"love\" such as obsession and worship. When the sound isn't heavy it can be creepy, but it all feels intelligent throughout.\r It really is one of the best nu-metal albums out there, and Slipknot shows that it can experiment with it's sound without sacrificing what so many fans love about them in the first place. It shows growth and a different maturity than the previous two albums. I give it a 9.2/10.\u2026 Expand",

It seems to happen to all bands that I like and hear about. They start off with their original sound that makes you fall in love with them, and they continue to be themselves for several more albums until BAM! Something like Volunteer comes out that has only one track that remotely reminds you of their original sound that you came to love them for. I feel the praised reviews that I have read, claiming that the band has \"matured\"(aka, sold out), are either favored/paid-for reviews or from people who are the typical \u201cWagon Wheeler\u201d who only care for Wagon Wheel and nothing else the band has ever done. This album reminds me of something you would hear in a film, playing in the background of a honky-tonk/country/redneck bar scene from the 90s.\r If this change was Ketch and the boys original intentions and direction for the band, then I would not have a problem at all. However, I feel that this change has only been brought on by some new, money-hungry producer that wants them more \u201cmainstream\u201d so they themselves can benefit with a nice healthy profit. The fact that if you watch or listen to any studio performance or interview with the band and still continue to hear Ketch Secor harp about their influence and continuation of old-time music, demonstrates this new producer\u2019s puppeteering because this new album is completely devoid of this sound that he loves and talks about. What made Old Crow so great was their originality and ability to bring the rock-n-roll energy and attitude to old-time music and turn so many new people on to a genre that they had never heard. The only thing that reminds you of old-time music on this new album is \u201cShout Mountain Music\u201d which reminds me of the ever so popular, \u201cMountain Music\u201d by Alabama, in which it uses a stale, mainstream sound and lyrically tries too hard to communicate an image of old time music because after all, real old-time music is not what the mainstream wants to hear. Actually sounding like real old time rock-n-rollers like Old Crow used to, would scare the mainstream listener away.\r The new album isn\u2019t bad necessarily, its just not for me because it\u2019s not the Old Crow Medicine Show that I came to love. With all of that said, I believe it is safe to say that Old Crow has officially sold out\u2026 for now. I just hope and pray that like the unfulfilling Tennessee Pusher album(which reminds me of a much more rough version of Volunteer), a kick-ass, return-to-our-roots album like Carry Me Back will follow.\u2026 Expand",

Ever since she received recognition from her single \"Vanessa\", critics and music listeners alike have failed to define her artistry and it's unknown to date. For example, it's not 'weird' enough to compare to Bjork and it's not artsy-poppy enough to compare to Ellie Goulding or Florence + the Machine. It's all courtesy of Grimes. And with Visions\u2014which is virtually produced by Grimes and Grimes only using GarageBand\u2014it's not any less true.\r Though it's no concept album, Visions has a caution in its production that's lacking in a lot of 'indietronica' (let's be honest, everyone's gonna call it indie because it's a critically acclaimed yet commercially unheard of artist). Despite retaining that dream pop and electronica influenced sound throughout its duration, each song has its own structure and more importantly, its own individual personality. If lead single \"Genesis\" didn't catch your attention with its ambient vibe and Brooke Candy-starring music video that has gathered more than 20 million views on Youtube, \"Oblivion\" had to have caught your ears from the beginning: bubbly electronica and Grimes' cutesy, lisp-y vocals accompanied by lyrics that are the exact opposite (\"And now the walk about after dark/It's my point of view/If someone could break your neck/Coming up behind you always coming and you'd never have a clue\"). Turning a personal experience\u2014previously dealing with assault\u2014into one of the year's catchiest melodies isn't easy.\r Visions requires patience in a sense that it takes multiple listens\u2014about as many as Grimes use of layering her vocals, which have been documented to reach up to 50\u2014and once the less climactic ones are skipped, it's a surprisingly pleasant experience the more it grows on you. A few of my favorite highlights that didn't catch me upon the first or second listen are \"Skin\", a seductive-in-a-Grimes-way ballad that transitions from soulful R&B to dark, calming synths you swore you remembered from a Blaqk Audio song, and \"Nightmusic\", which definitely takes the witchy concepts of its music video to heart and induces a nightly euphoria until the very end. Grimes has certainly caught the eye of many and to many, her recent collaboration on the far too trendy trap-tastic \"Go\" completely contrasts her work on Visions. But that's just Grimes, her ability to create accessible yet jarring electropop makes her one of the most coveted artists in the underground music world right now.\u2026 Expand",

The usually, emotionally reticent, Liverpudlians came out of their \"shell\" (so to speak) on \"Witching Hour\", resulting in some of the best hook-laden Electronica/ Electro-clash/pop/etc I've ever heard, with nary a clunker in the bunch. However, with their latest, they seemed to have reverted back to a relatively cool (both temperature and attitude wise) stance, resulting in a loss of, I feel, forward momentum, artistically speaking (considering what came before it). Nearly half of \"Velocifero\" is great: \"Versus\" (the album's BEST track), \"Ghosts\", \"I'm Not Scared\", \"Deep Blue\" (icy, yes, but Mira's sexy delivery saves it), and \"Kletva\" (despite it sticking out incongruously) are my favourite tracks. The rest is decent-to-plain-weak. Just because it's more propulsive, energetic and dance-inducing (which, I understand has pleased fans of their earlier material) doesn't necessarily make for a \"great album\".

My problem with it is that there are a few songs here that are actually perfect and show what Grizzly Bear is capable of. Both Horn of Plenty and Yellow House interspersed their \"wow\" moments evenly throughout the album, often putting them in the middle of songs that meandered and explored musical space for a few minutes before really opening up. The result was fascinating and consistent. On Veckatimest, they have split their explorations and their explosions into different songs entirely, and it's incredibly frustrating to me. After hearing a Two Weeks or While You Wait for the Others, both of which are pop perfection all the way through, it becomes harder to want Grizzly Bear to meander on a song like Dory (easily the weakest track on here). So ultimately, the opening and closing of the album are some of the best I will hear all year, but the middle drags in a way that other Grizzly Bear albums haven't.\u2026 Expand",

Every song on this eponymous debut is a keeper, with the possible exception of \"Bryn\". Will Vampire Weekend keep this stripped down approach, or will they open up their sound. Do they have a \"Remain in Light\" in them? This ain't no shanty town; this ain't no Johannesberg; this ain't no fooling around. This is Cape Cod.

Perhaps this needs some time to grow on me, but I've scrutinized the music here for more than half an hour, and left underwhelmed.

I would definitely revisit some of these tracks a little more in the future, especially \"Walcott\". There are a bunch of good songs to hear, but few GREAT ones.\r I give this a 7 out of 10.

When a friend recommended them to me, I decided to give it a go and try their first out. Bottom line: I was not disappointed. The way that Vampire Weekend uses instrumentation is very fun to listen to, creating a pop-reggae feel. Though it seemed like the vocals were hard to hear at first, in a little time I was able to discern what the lead singer was conveying. The music was the true MVP of this release, though. The work begins with Mansard Roof, and I liked that the vocals were right in at the start of the song. The keyboard and drums were highlights, and the strings were a nice touch. I liked the drums and keyboard again in Oxford Comma, as they seem to work well at creating a unique vibe. The expletives were a bit unnecessary, however, and it was a little hard to hear the vocals. I enjoyed the guitar solo on the other hand, as well as the use of panning the bongos. The way the music was put together was super fun, and the building at the end of the song was definitely a fun touch. A-Punk\u2019s guitar intro was lovely, and the bass sounded great throughout. I loved how upbeat the song was and how the song was a story. The flute sounded fantastic here, and I liked the sudden ending. The intro of Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa was great and I really liked the vibe that was created.The only thing against it was the case of unnecessary language, but the problem is ignorable due to the impressive piano solo and creative bassline. M79 seemed almost classical in its makeup, displayed in the way that the string intro was different and fun to listen to. I appreciated that it was just drums and bass in verse, as this created another great vibe. All the instruments used blended exceedingly well together, and the vocal harmony was an additional highlight. I liked Campus\u2019s music, and the lyrics were really good in the verses though a little repetitive in choruses and bridges. It was a pretty good song, but I wish it wasn\u2019t as redundant. Bryn was a very enjoyable song. The electric guitar riff was great and I loved the different time signature. The louder vocals were a fantastic bonus. All of the music was awesome in One, but the vocals were a bit hard to listen to and there seemed to be too much going on at times. I Stand Corrected was a great track overall. I appreciated the uniqueness of the chill, different-sounding keyboard intro. The upbeat drums (especially the toms) were a plus, along with the keys, guitar, and driving bass. Walcott\u2019s loud piano intro was nice if familiar, and I thought it was cool that it referenced other songs on the album. While the lyrics certainly had a few really good lines, I thought the language was unnecessary, and the words seemed just a bit repetitive at the end. The bass and toms were also really good in The Kids Don\u2019t Stand A Chance. The loud vocals were also nice, and even though it was a slower song I still really liked it. The whole thing sounded \u201cecho-y,\u201d which was fun, and the piano sounded nice with all the other music. The harpsichord was a new, unique addition, and the higher vocal range sounded nice. The fade out was a great way to end the album, and after listening to this song, I want to know more of its meaning. In general, I was exceedingly pleased with this outing and I was certainly rewarded for trying something new and venturing into \u201cpreviously uncharted territory.\u201d I loved the feel of music that this band had to offer, and if the only good things about the music were the uses of drums and bass, this would still be worth the listen. Vampire Weekend\u2019s first, titular album was an amazing start to the group\u2019s career, and is compelling me to listen to more of their stuff. I will certainly have the next release on my radar for upcoming albums to review. Highlights: Mansard Roof, A-Punk, Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa, M79, Bryn, I Stand Corrected, and The Kids Don\u2019t Stand A Chance.\u2026 Expand",

All of this to sell more and have more platinum-certified discs. Only artists like Beyonc\u00e9 with \"Lemonade\" or Rihanna with \"Anti\" have still put their energy in making a good LP, one to listen to track by track; one to enjoy for a full hour without caring about sales. This is exactly what J Balvin has done with this amazing project.\rThe Colombian artist has decided to release an authentic album. One that both the critics and public can enjoy, \"Vibras\" has a simply funny track and a correct roller-coaster sound. Knowing that a large amount of people have all this prejudices about reggaeton music like it only talks about sex, drugs and beautiful subordinated women, Balvin has been able to put a record that eradicates all this glitches and that feels like a celebration of life with no discrimination. 43 minutes of pure fun and sensuality; a 43 minute-long spring break in Miami, Canc\u00fan and Andalusia.\rThis is pop rap done right by far. Pulling influences from throughout the western hemisphere (dancehall, trap, latin pop, reggaeton, R&B...), J Balvin has made a massive splash with this international breakthrough of an album. One of the tools that were used to make an album seem mystical and interesting are interludes. Thanks to God, this tool has resurrected after almost ten years of no use. Balvin has created a couple of very intelligent interludes for the album which are able to change the party atmosphere to a sensual one in a smoothy agressive way. See so, Vibras is perfectly named, as Balvin and his collaborators create 45 minutes of humid, sexy, crepuscular vibes.  To sum up, the use he has given to these interludes, has completed this album and has made it even greater! Another point in his favour is that he hasn't collaborated with any of his gang members nor anyone of the industry's elite. He has given a platform to amazing artists like Willy William, Carla Morrison or Rosal\u00eda (who sings two songs even though only being credited in one) to make their names bigger with the last one being the most benefited from this opportunity.\rIn conclusion, \"Vibras\" is an amazing, catchy, summer essential album with a sensual and fun atmosphere that makes it one of the (if not the) best and most consistant albums of 2018 and one of the greatest in the reggaeton genre.\u2026 Expand",

About half of its songs are awesome, but sadly, a good portion of them are not quite as good. Attention is one (if not my favorite) of my favorite songs, with one of the most epic bass lines ever. How Long is fantastic, and just as good. LA Girls is not a horrible song, but the lyrics could be a little better in the verses and the bass is a little too quiet. I love the lyrics in Change, but the actual music isn\u2019t quite as good as the other songs, although the \u201cacousticness\u201d of the song is welcome in such an upbeat album. Boy is fantastic, there\u2019s nothing more I need to say about that. Through it all is a little lackluster and Patient and If You Leave Me Now seem generic in this album. Slow it down, sadly had really no appeal to me as a song, both its music and lyrics iffy. Overall, Voicenotes contains some very high quality songs, but it is weighed down by some generic ones as well.\u201d\r Having just finished reviewing Charlie Puth\u2019s hidden album, Ego (and really enjoying it), I realized that I may have marked down songs in Puth\u2019s other albums that I wouldn\u2019t take points off for now (6 months can really do a lot to a person\u2019s music taste). Therefore, I decided to do something I hadn\u2019t done before: re-review an album. I ended up giving four more songs in Voicenotes favorites symbols (The Way I Am, LA Girls, Done For Me, and Somebody Told Me) and raising the scores of five (LA Girls, Patient, If You Leave Me Now, Slow it Down, and Somebody Told Me), while only taking points off of one (Empty Cups). I used to really hate electronic music, but now that I am able to stomach it more (and sometimes even enjoy it), I was able to award a lot more points to Voicenotes than I had before. I kept favorites symbols on the songs I knew I loved and gave the others another go. As I mentioned before, seven had improved scores, though I felt the same about some of the songs, like Through it All, which didn\u2019t feel like it belonged in this more energetic album. I also wasn\u2019t too fond of Patient, but I felt less strongly about it than in my first listening of it. The other songs in the album were fantastic, though, showcasing Charlie Puth\u2019s talent as a musician really well through tracks that are really fun to jam to. This is definitely a much better album than I gave credit for the first time around. I definitely recommend it! Highlights: The Way I Am, Attention, LA Girls, How Long, Done For Me, If You Leave Me Now, Boy, Slow it Down, and Somebody Told Me.\u2026 Expand",

Somebody That I Used to Know was but a sneak peek into the mystical world of this brilliant Kiwi singer/composer.\r enter Vows, an art pop album with a longevity equivalent to that of The Dreaming. more similarities with art pop goddess Kate are present, but it would be unfair to merely compare this young talent. after all, she's a newcomer in the pop stratosphere, and a damn ingenious one at that. avid listeners of left-field pop music are often on the lookout for masterclasses in songwriting, depth and production. The Archandroid, OK Computer, Elliott Smith's Either/Or and now Vows are on my list of quintessential pop records of the past 3 or so decades, and I'm certainly not the only one who'd say so.\r a startling quantity of tangible emotion is present on this record, and Kimbra proves her potential with her interpretations. there's omnipotent anger (Come Into My Head, Posse), bright-eyed romance (Two Way Street), nostalgia (Old Flame, Sally I Can See You), mania (Cameo Lover), even sensuality (Wandering Limbs). the highest points though, are when she gets remarkably soulful. Good Intent is seductive, jazzy, a song you'd likely hear in a neo-noir short film directed by the likes of David Lynch, a startling highlight. bonus track Call Me is another fresh highlight, blending Jeff Buckleyesque runs with a Worldwide Underground-redolent funk beat. strange on paper, but erudite aurally. while Kimbra's lyrics may seem to occasionally dip into teenage-diary territory, it ends up actually playing in her favor, creating unique lyrical dissonances. and of course, her lyrical abilities can only go up from here.\r so I mean yeah, comparisons with Bj\u00f6rk, Kate Bush and Janelle totally make sense. and they are compliments to the highest degree. go the **** off, New Zealand.\u2026 Expand",

From the Princesque pop ditty 'Mama Told Me' (featuring a sexy-sounding Kelly Rowland) to the straight-up Dirty South banger 'In the A', and more the more electronic numbers 'Objectum Sexuality' and 'Lines' - both featuring Phantogram - there's something for everyone here. But rather than catering to all tastes with three or four songs, Patton succeeds in making a mockery of genres and scenes. Which is to say that this album is just as approachable for a tight-jeaned indie scenester as it is an 80s funk or hip-hop diehard, or a present-day pop and R'n'B devotee.\r There is absolutely no filler here whatsoever, but perhaps the most intriguing cut of all is 'Shoes for Running', a collaboration with Wavves and the oft-derided B.o.B, who rides the choppy guitars which separate the anthemic, chanty-indie verses with ease. As any hip-hop-head will tell you, Big Boi's 2010 effort 'Sir Lucious Left Foot' was easily the album of its year, and 'Vicious Lies' is mounting a serious if last-ditch challenge for this year's award.

The end of \"U got me?\" was a revealing point of this album, as Drake shows more emotion and ambition than the entire rest of the album combined. Despite being a mighty 20 tracks long, VIEWS comes off as lazy and unambitious, content to stick to safer sounds and overdone subject matter.

The first track has the only legitimately ambitious instrumental on the project, half of the songs are bland, tasteless and uninteresting, there are only two actual bangers on the project, and to be honest, the best song might still be \"Hotline Bling\" which has been included as a Bonus track rather than embedded within the album. I was hoping Drake would continue to realize that the whole schmuck gimmick had died off, but he fails to maintain the respect he instilled in me (and many others) with his last project.\r Hopefully we get something more impressive from him next time, but honestly I doubt it.\u2026 Expand",

Then his mixtape with Future that spawned the single \"Jumpman\" where Drake just Drakes all over Future beats while Future was just there for the ride. Then during all that he won a very lob-sided feud over Meek Mill. Though Mill had a better position on the issue, Drake slaughtered him with a series of pretty mediocre diss tracks.\rIt's been a solid five years since Drake has release a great album. His 2011 album \"Take Care\" was nothing short of phenomenal. With a few duds at the end, it wasn't a classic, but it does have a big handful of the best tracks Drake has ever had anything to do with. Views is basically tracks 12-18 on Take Care but less interesting. It's slow, uninspired, lazy lyrics and nothing that tells you to stick around.\rDrake completely out-draked Drake in the most Drake way possible in Views. At twenty tracks long we hear some tracks that could have been enjoyable had the beats been a little bit more pronounced and in your face, but they all seem extremely watered down. To make matters worse Drake took out the features from Poppocan, Kanye West and Jay Z. Drake just Drakes all over every single track and even when there is a guest feature, Drake shows up and Drakes over their part. It's almost as if he just can't handle not having complete control over this album. What's sad is that the guest features on this album are the parts that give this album life, but they're so few and far between the album just seems dead in between.\rLyrically the album is so Drake that it hurts. It's so uninspired, and it spawns some of the weakest lines ever put into a rap song. \"Like when Crystler made that one car that looked just like the bently.\" What in the? It's like Drake can't have enough Drake so he's having conversations with himself in the music. It's painful to say the least.\rUltimately this Drake is so Drake that not even Drake can Drake enough.

'Worst Behavior' was one of the edgiest records I'd heard  in years and 'hotline Bling' was f*cking Brilliant. Drake is Smart, as a fan of his music I just hope he continues to be edgy.\rIn the 80's, Superstar Eddie Murphy at the top of his Game was asked why he doesn't do stand up anymore and his answer was: \"it's hard to be funny when your writing jokes on a $80,000 Oak Desk\".

I'm getting tired of the trap beats Drake raps on. His mixtape was full of them but it was not an actual studio album, it was really successful and also that was new to him, so I understand that. But the rap songs here have average lyrics and beats are not that good as some of his diehard fans claim. There are certainly some catchy tracks on Views and some good moments, but he seems to be at a point on his career where he doesn't know which direction he should take. He made this album to please his fans, now for the next time he should make an album to please the art.\u2026 Expand",

The subject matter was classic Drake, with boasts of being on top and laments of relationships gone wrong and friendships turned sour. It was all surface level, with no great detail of any of these stories offered to keep the listener interested. Similar ground was covered to a superior standard on Take Care & NWTS. It continues to baffle me how Drake is so popular. His songs are beginning to blur together at this point- identical tempos and subject matter & uncreative, meandering flows sang with the same puppy dog inflection. It's all getting very boring now. Drake is due a major reinvention as an artist (subject matter, production, flows, ANYTHING) if he wants to go down with the greats and I'm very disappointed it didn't come close to fruition on this album. It was all one long interlude with not much happening, lots of filler, forgettable features and an impressive production style that all the same grew very tiresome due to a lack of variation over what was a way overlong album. I have no doubt the masses will eat this up but that is more of a sad indictment of the fickle nature of music 'fans' rather than an appraisal of Drake's talent behind a mic, which is exposed as no more than average album-by-album.\u2026 Expand",

One Dance is EASILY, one of the WORST songs I've heard this year so far. I hoped this stayed off here, but, it's here and I am mad. Faithful is the same, a good track, Pimp C is good on it. I don't hate it. I do hate how Hotline Bling is on here. SERIOUSLY, IT MAKES NO SENSE LYRICALLY AND IT MAKES ME WANT TO FALL ASLEEP! Same goes for the album. I never wanted Thank Me Later Drake again. But we got him, and it's WORSE than that album. He's only rapping on about 5-6 tracks, where we got the If Your Reading This Drake. In fact, I did like a few of his singing tracks, like Faithful, Weston Road Flows, and Controlla. I did also like 9, Hype, With You, Grammys, Childs Play, and Views. That's it for highlights. I'm fine with slow moving Hip-Hop, if it's done well. Here, it's not, no, not at all. If you only actually LOVE 2-20 tracks (Weston Road Flows and Views) you didn't do something right drake. The beat work is mediocre, the lyrics are sloppy, Drake's story isn't interesting, the features are average, and it's way too long (which doesn't help it being slow moving). Why didn't I give it a 1 or a light 2? Well, I enjoyed 9 tracks, but only came out with 2 that i legit will enjoy for a long time.

In fact, remove One Dance, Too Good, Summers Over (the non sensical interlude). redemption, Hotline Bling, U With Me?, Feel No Ways, and Still Here. Put a Summer Sixteen and a few actually good tracks that have not been released yet, you can cut the track list down 1/4 and a 1/2 AND have a good album.

It's clunky, bloated, irritating and occasionally downright boring. But with that said, there is some interesting material rammed into this 20 track offering.\r On this release, Drake tosses everything he's ever done to rap out the window to focus on R&B and dancehall, which are seen as primary influences in the middle of the record (\"Controlla\", \"One Dance\"). On tracks that do contain rap, the bars seem tired and lacking passion compared to his older LPs. Still, there is a bit of grit on standout tracks \"Still Here\" and \"U With Me?\". This back and forth between genres, though seemingly unfocused, somewhat aligns with Drake's goal of creating a record that starts in winter, cycles through summer and returns to winter.\r The record has a story and interesting tones as well as several excellent tracks but overall it seems too packed and way overhyped. 20 tracks doesn't seem necessary. At least 7 weren't needed at all and others could've been shortened or condensed into other songs.\r Overall, nearly 90% of everything on Views was a risk and maybe 50% of that risky material paid off. The other stuff? Kind of forgettable. Stick with 'Take Care' and 'Nothing Was the Same' and come back to 'Views' when you're finally tired of them.\r And I'm still mad \"Controlla' was ruined.

While the production on the album is very strong throughout, Drake did not bring much of anything that he has not done before to the table. His lyricism throughout is repetitive and inconsistent, focusing on old relationships, just as all of his other albums do to a certain degree. It clocks in at around 80 minutes and it feels even longer, as it is a rather boring album. I'd put at the bottom of the list of Drake albums, as even the one new style he tried to introduce onto the album, the tropical style found in songs like Controlla and Hotline Bling, does not really work that well. Interestingly, I found the instrumental outros on songs like U With Me? and Faithful, among others, to be highlights of the album. Drake is very good at his craft and this album is still a solid output, but it just does not reach its full potential and definitely does not justify the hype, as it feels a bit mailed-in. 6.2/10.

I'm glad he didn't make those distractions the focus of the album though and made it more about his roots, his family and the city he represents.  Overall, I think this is Drake's best and most cohesive sounding work to date; he's really found what makes him consistent and refined it to the maximum. Views definitely lives up to the hype and I think it will be seen by many as a classic album in the near future.\u2026 Expand",

WOW, nobody can look 100% objectively at things but 3/10? Come on man!\r Ok so the album starts with the song \"Keep The Family Close\" - one of drakes best intros for sure - which gives the album directly from the start some kind of movie feeling. I personally think the Song sounds like some kind of James Bond theme song. Love it!\rThe next song is \"9\". At first i really thought this song was lame and mediocre, but after a few listens it grew on me pretty much. But to me this is probably still one of the weaker songs on the album. But this song just shows again perfectly how you have to let the album sink in before writing a negative review on metacritic.\rThe next few songs are really really great.\r\"U with me?\" Is probably together with \"Weston Road Flows\" my favorite song on the whole thing. Great atmosphere + nice beat switch up = great song! Nothing more to say.\r\"Feel No Ways\", man the production on this one... damn! Again one of the better songs on \"VIEWS\".\r\"Hype\" is a great party tune. After my first listen i knew pretty soon that this is going to be one of my favs.\r\"Weston Road Flows\". Like i said probably ties with \"U WIth Me?\" for me, but those tunes are exactly my type of song.\r\"Redemption\" got that late night vibe to it, really like it.\r\"With you\" is one of the few songs i just cant stand on this one. I dont know but this sounds to dumb and chart orientated in my opinion.\r\"Faithful\" is take care era drakes return! I already got one girl i connect to this song lmao.\r\"Still Here\" again a more hyped track. Sounds nice!\r\"Controlla\"! Ok so this one is going to be a chartbreaker for sure! Its probably one of the greatest summer themed songs i've ever listened to! Wow!\r\"One Dance\" We already know this one, not really my type of song but still pretty cachy!\r\"Grammys\" is a great turn up song, but man futures part couldve been better, still a great song though.\r\"Childs Play\" is the second song for me on this album that just wont grow on me. Dont like this song, sounds exactly like \"With you\" too childish. lmao the irony on this one.\r\"Pop Style\" is - like one dance - one of the songs we already knew, and honestly i dont get why so much hate is concentrated on this song! I love it, especially the part \"I cannot be gotten thats a given\", hypes me up every time.\r\"Too Good\" is one of those soon to be chart breakers on \"VIEWS\". Very catchy and overall a great song with a beautiful feature.\rThe interlude after this fits quite nice and sounds great aswell.\r\"Fire & Desire\" - this song is perfect for you when you're in a relationship!\r\"Views\" - a great outro for a great album!\r Overall i'd give it a 9/10 but since the user score is like 6.5 thanks to **** like \"SXN80\" i gotta rate it 10/10.\u2026 Expand",

Slightly agree that he played it a bit too safe, especially in his verses. Doesn't have a lot of punch lines that will stick with you like some of his previous work in IYRTITL and Nothing Was The Same, but the distinctiveness of each song and mixing is definitely there. Listen to this album in order from the first track with headphones on, the same way you listened to Nothing Was The Same, or other introspective albums. I read somewhere that this is more of a 3am after the club album than a 12am club banger album and that is totally fine. The big hits are Pop Style, One Dance, Hype, Too Good, and Still Here, while others really really grew on me like Redemption, Fire & Desire. He has a lot of different sounds in this album but they all fit TORONTO, which is something people do not understand. The diversity, the energy and the seasonal variation is felt throughout the album. Songs like Feel No Ways, Keep the Family Close, and Views are examples of this. One major criticism I have is for an album titled VIEWS (previously from the 6), I felt like his songwriting was really lacking. He had lots of chances from tracks like Keep the Family Close, U With Me?, Weston Road Flows, and Views to really tell his story, but they were dragged down by repetition about ex-girlfriends and the life of a rapper. I missed the well written verses from tracks like Too Much, Know Yourself, etc. from his previous work. Overall, FAR FROM a bad album. Don't listen to the haters, give this one a chance, let it grow on you and just enjoy the vibes. 2nd best Drake album after Nothing Was The Same.\u2026 Expand",

While I love most of the records on here, I have to give it a 9 due to it being a few too many songs. 20 songs takes away from the overall feel and movement of the project as a whole, but there isn't much negatives here. Only song I can really say I don't care for is \"Too Good\" featuring Rihanna. Very solid record from Drake with Views, just wish he cut a little out. Light 9 out of 10 for me.\u2026 Expand",

From the get go the opener is like a Buble/Bond movie soundtrack and it was so unexpected I genuinely didn't know what to expect when '9' popped up. Songs like U With Me?, Weston Road Flows, Hype, Still Here, Grammys and Views show us Drake can still go top tier with his bars and delivery whilst the crooning on songs like Redemption and Fire & Desire showcase what Drake does best in terms of his laid back night time driving catalogue.\r I really love how the album captures the seasons in the sounds, it remains Diverse hitting highs and lows left and right and yet in my honest opinion remains incredibly cohesive.

I decided to put it in at 10/10 to combat the wave of extreme and undeserved hate I am seeing. Anyways, Drake delivers his more adventurous album yet on Views with imaginative production, tight and cohesive story lines and introspective bars. With Drake, there will always be controversy as he does not make it easy to fit him into a category musically. On this album he mixes Rap, R&B, and Carribean influenced music to create a body of work that is strong individually and unique. The songs (like every album) need to be listened to more than once and in the order intended by the artist - after doing so, I can say that I appreciate an artist that can present music that is TRUTHFUL to his personal experience. To some others, the wave of 'concept' albums that have no basis on the actual artist are exciting. I am personally moved by music that I know is connected to the life and experiences of the artist, this is the albums's biggest achievement. For those that liked Take Care, Views is a matured and sophisticated version. Enjoy!\u2026 Expand",

This album is the fourth studio album that Drake has released, the album was recorded from 2014 to 2016.

At first \u201cViews\u201d got bad rating saying \u201cIt's just like his old albums.\u201d\r The album has a lot more stuff inter-twinned with it then you would first think, the name \u201cViews From The Six\u201d is a reference to his hometown Toronto, Ontario. The album cover is of Drake sitting on top of the CN tower in Toronto. He released this photo on twitter in 2016. There was a lot of controversies whether or not it was a real picture or photoshopped, later in that month a spokesperson from CN tower confirmed it was photoshopped.\r In the whole album \u201cViews\u201d there were twenty songs and five singles. There were 21 different vocalists that have a place in this album. 7 musicians, 7 technicians, and 30 record producers. The album was played on 26 different radio stations with the lowest rating of 31 on Hungarian Albums. It also had a number 1 rating on 11 stations with a number one on 11 on all of the US stations.\r I believe that this album is a very emotional one like all of Drake's music it come from the heart and he makes them all so that they are relatable. You can either relate through good emotions or bad emotions like pain or happiness depending on how you can relate is how you're going to see the songs point, another way to see that these songs are emotional to drake is that he named the album after his hometown. Drake also made a building from his hometown the album's cover art.\r My view on this album is it is too emotional for me I don't like to show my emotions a whole lot so when I listen to most of these songs. There are only about 4-5 songs on this album that I can't actually listen to without wanting to turn it off or skip the song all of these songs hit you at different levels of emotions which are not my type of music but it others.\r In conclusion, I think that Drake's album \u201cViews\u201d is a good album, and it is very emotional. It helps the listener get into the music through all the different types of emotions coming out of it. I would recommend giving this album a try to see if you like it because if you do then you now have more music to listen to and if you hate it well then stop listening to it.\u2026 Expand",

The problem with this album is that there are too many different things being juggled, without enough cohesion to tie them all together.

I have been a drake fan for a number of years, and I am used to albums like \"take care\" and \"nothing was the same\". I have noticed that this album almost seems slept on already despite the amount of sales and shares. People often overlook the finer details of an album when hearing music, they just tend to listen to the singles and the songs from other albums as a comparison.\rI personally LOVE this side of drake. The songs have more meaning, more depth and more atmosphere. Rarely can you feel lost while listening to an album as if its a story. I think drake really hit home with this album which was the aim of the album I think with the connection to his roots.\r For those of you who appreciate good music, and not popular hype, this album is for you. If you wanted to see drake releasing more tracks like \"HYFR\" and \"take care\", you wont get this on Views.\r This is more of a laid back reminiscent type album where you find yourself deep in thought but relaxed at the same time while listening to Views.\r Some people may criticise this album claiming it is no \"NWTS\" or \"Take Care\", but that was a different side to drake, just as this is a different side to him on the Views album. My favourite drake album is NWTS, then probably take care with views a close third. Nothing beats those two albums but that doesn't mean you should take anything away from views either.\r A lot of people have dismissed this album because they were expecting some hype with future as previously done with the \"what a time to be alive\" mixtape, but this is more of a matured drake.\r Plus, songs like Feel no ways, Fire & desire, views, and controlla go way beyond expectation.\r 10/10\u2026 Expand",

Or maybe \"Got so many chains, they call me chaining Tatum\"............. These are laughable, almost sad lines from somebody like Drake.

Drake had a lot on his plate in 2015 releasing two albums, and that may be the reason this is an underwhelming studio album. Maybe Drake was doing too much, its weird that his \"surprise mixtape\" IYRTITL was much more impressive than this much anticipated project. Overall the album is just so tired and boring half the time on the tracks Drake himself sounds bored and disinterested in what he is spitting. Its assembly line crap filled with struggle bars like \" Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum\" \" Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake\rYou know I love to go there\" and \"You toyin with it like happy meal\" I mean those are not bars drake should be putting into songs at this stage of his career, these sound like lines a 15 year old would throw into a song, someone get Quentin Miller in the building stat.\u2026 Expand",

They were able to get the public talking and other fans hope for more from Drake. However,  the rest of the album that was handed to us did not fulfill the hype, nor the hunger of many rap fans. With the exception of 9, the rest of the tracks were full of the repetitive Drake style with a weaker production. Despite Drizzy's undeniably excellent flow and lyricism, it was not enough to carry this album.\r As said before, most of the faults fall upon the sound, which did not spark anything inside me. Bombastic rap is unappliable with this album. A collection of souless music with no ambition nor charm to it has driven the hype back and makes most fans fear what lies ahead for Drake. Don't expect this album to age well in the near future. An album that doesn't sit well with millenium times despite its heavy concentration within its content cannot be expected to go far.\r Drake has usually prevailed with his fans, but this is a loss that is irreversible in his discography.\u2026 Expand",

Hotline Bling, i still listen to it that says something about it 10/10\r Standouts are Childs Play, Too Good & Hotline Bling\r Overall: 6.65 (rounded up to 7) Drake is a phenomenal artist but he has better albums within him, Scorpion could have been an amazing 15 track album and this could have been a legendary 12 track Drake album. His problem is just too many bad songs , not that they shouldn't be released. He could have released the bad songs on Soundcloud to please the fans. Drake has better in him, and the second half of the album is a 9/10 within itself.\u2026 Expand",

The track \"Headstone\" accumulates an impressive number of samples, from decent to incredible. By the way the overall production by Erick the Architect is terrific and allows the trio to freestyle and give birth to unbelievably powerful flows. The whole project can seem messy from time to time due to the desire to create many bangers. However, moments like the instrumental part on the last track featuring the monster Denzel Curry 'The Glory' simply remains miraculous. Helped by this terrific production Flatbush Zombies manage to highlight their influences while making a full inspired and original product on their own.\r It's obvious that they couldn't help but try to impress us as much as possible, which explains the huge amount of songs and many fillers.

But i think Anderson would've benefited from working a little longer on this project, for it to feel like a fully fleshed out soul/ jazz rap album that he wants to create. I feel like his best music still lies ahead, with 3 or 4 standout songs from Ventura and Oxnard, Malibu is impeccable for the most part.\r I feel like a light to a decent 8 on this one.\r Favourite songs: Make it better,  jet black, king James, come home\u2026 Expand",

Does this take away from the music, you're damn right it does. Would Moving Pictures have been nearly as successful if it was produced like VT? Of course not. Raw - what exactly does that mean? An excuse to make an album sound like crap? I consider Appetite for Destruction to be extremely raw, because it's not processed and it wasn't poorly produced. Yet, it sounds incredible and will continue to do so. Again, Rush is my favorite and always will be. VT is a solid collection of songs, even though I do miss the keyboards, but the sound is simply an attrocious embarresment.

It sounds like what I imagine their home demos sound like, but shoved up a compressor's ass. You need more than a Pro-Tools rig to make a good record - you need a musical outsider to tell you when you're putting bad ideas down (a producer) and an engineer who actually has any business behind a sound board. And this is coming from a rabid Rush fanatic who has enough of a collection that fan-friendly Alex would be uncomfortable, including mint audiophile vinyl pressings from Holland and Germany of more than half their released albums. Indeed, this is not Rush at their best; but it's not exactly Rush's fault they're at their worst.\u2026 Expand",

As far as I'm concerned, anything other than \"Caress of Steel\" and \"2112\" is almost a 10, but not quite. Still by far my favorite group ever and I will buy anything they put out, good or not.\u2026 Expand",

I saw them on the Moving Pictures tour when transportation problems made them 2 hours late for the show.

This Rush album is a welcome edition to their powerful catalog and the differences in the sound are one thing I really enjoy. Change is usually good in life and this is no exception. A powerful disc that never fails to deliver the goods as Rush have done for the most part in their illustrious career. I recommend this disc to any Rush fan and actually rank it among my top 8 of their releases. It needs no \"remastering\" or other doctoring. All it needs is a good cd player and a set of ears who appreciates Rush and change.\u2026 Expand",

They came back and did this album.  I feel like the fact that they hadn\u2019t been with each other for a while affected them a little bit.  They still wrote good stuff, but it just sounded a little weird.  It sounded weird, because the music was too crazy for Geddy lee\u2019s voice to keep up with.  Geddy\u2019s voice started changing with this album.  It was just as high, but weaker, and you could tell that he was really struggling to hit certain notes.  Geddy never had a good voice, but they were always able to make it work.  I found that this was the one time that it didn\u2019t work.  The music sounded louder and crazier then any of their other stuff, but his weaker voice I felt like at times couldn\u2019t keep up with it.  When he would sing the song normally it was okay, but when he would try to raise his voice or belt it out he sounded like he was struggling to do it.  That is the one flaw with this album.  But even though the voice didn\u2019t sound like it always worked for the record it was still a very well written, and well-done record.  If they just toned down the distortion and the volume of the album I think Geddy\u2019s voice would have worked for it.  The more you listen to it the more it grows on you, because you appreciate the writing.  It is a good heavy metal album.  These guys never make albums that are bad.  They make albums that aren\u2019t perfect like this one, but never make bad ones.\r The best song off of this album is \u201cSecret Touch.\u201d  It has a great beat, and very interesting lyrics.  It is one of the more unique ones off of the record.  It takes them back to their style of doing really long songs, which this one is.  It is the longest one off of this CD, but you don\u2019t feel it though.  It has been revealed to be one of Geddy Lee\u2019s favorite tracks, and when you listen to it you will understand why.  Great song.\r \u201cOne Little Victory\u201d is the first track off of the album, and it grabs you with a great beat from Neil Peart, and a really fast guitar played by Alex Lifeson.  Though it is definitely one of the highlights off of the track it is one of those songs I was talking about where Geddy\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t always keep up with the heavy music.  Once it gets to the chorus I felt like he was trying to belt it out the way he belts out songs like \u201c2112\u201d but he couldn\u2019t because he was losing the strength of his voice.  Other then the moments where his voice doesn\u2019t add up it is a very good song.\r \u201cHow It Is\u201d I would say is the best track after \u201cSecret Touch.\u201d  It has a more interesting sound then most of the songs on this album.  It also has some interesting lyrics that are hard to understand, because of the way the song is sung, but when you look them up they are very interesting.  Neil Peart is the most underrated lyricist, and it is songs like this that show it.\r The rest of the songs are good, but those are the three that stuck with me the most.  However I find that when a guitar gets distorted you can\u2019t hear it clearly, and it can often make songs sound the same.  There are several songs off of this album that sound similar to me due to a heavily distorted guitar.  They would probably be more unique if they sounded more like the 70\u2019s guitar.  Other then a few flaws this is a very good album, with many good songs.  It is very energetic, and upbeat music.  Every song has a good drive to it.  Rush fans will not be disappointed.\u2026 Expand",
