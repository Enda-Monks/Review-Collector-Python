Although the music in general isn't as great as \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\", the emotions here are somewhat deeper and more powerful . Even though some listeners may find Chirs Martin's lyrics on the edge of platitude, no one will regret the fact it's beautiful. If you're into heartfelt songs above love and heartache, \"X&Y\" is definitely the album for you.\u2026 Expand",

Now they make us wait three years and the best that they can come up with is X&Y, a cheesy, cliche-ridden album that features at least seven tracks that are blatantly and shamelessly either ripping off or trying to aspire to the same style of U2 (Lord knows why Coldplay would want to try and copy them). Any distinctiveness and originality that Coldplay once had is almost completely lost. The only bright spots are Fix You, which is an insant classic and if Colplay is smart they will make it their second single, Talk, and the first single Speed of Sound. It's sad being a Coldplay fan for so long (ever since I heard an EP with Bigger, Stronger on it five years ago) only to have them release such a mundane third, and possibly final album.\u2026 Expand",

The album is not particularly varied (minus two points) but there are many wonderful tracks, such as the opening track and a track near the end titled \"Low\" which show that Coldplay is trying new things and are willing to break from the formula of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus. I feel this is more artsy than their \"AROBTTH\" fans would want, but I am enjoying this album, and I think Parachutes fans will, too. \"X&Y\" is well worth the money I would say. The song titled \"Low\" is up there with Radiohead's stuff. One more thing, Coldplay is vocally better than Radiohead, but I will admit Radiohead is more adventurous instrumentally. Kid A and Amnesiac are each worth 9 out of 10 in my opinion. I considered \"AROBTTH\" to be a waste of money, worth only 5 out of 10 at best. \"Clocks\" and the title track \"AROBTTH\" are all I listen to off that album now. I wish they would have included Moses. That was a good song live. Parachutes is worth a 10 out of 10 because the vocals were perfect, the compositional instrumentation was varied, and \"High Speed,\" \"Spies,\" \"Don't Panic\" and all the rest of the songs that didn't make it to radio were wonderful. I recommend people listen to entire album before you judge. Another album I would give a 10 out of 10 is \"Mmhmm\" by Relient K. They are still a baby band (not even on metacritic yet).\u2026 Expand",

After such a long break between AROBTTH and X&Y, I was a bit nervous and axious to hear the new material. I had heard a lot about the guys going in different directions musically, and was worried that Coldplay might change too much from the last record to this. However upon first listen I was reassured, the Coldplay that I have loved for 5 years, is indeed back. And in a BIG way. Obviously X&Y is a major work of growth for the band, with just enough new ideas to excite and intigue us, while maintaining the core sound that is the identity of this band. From heavier tunes like X&Y and Twisted Logic, to Soaring Ballads like Fix You and Swalled in the Sea. From uptempo anthems such as Low and White Shadows to the almost accoustic Til Kingdom come, I would consider X&Y to be as complete as any album could possibly be. I am obviously not technically musical and I could not tell you anything about chords or riffs, but to me only one thing matters when considering a peice of music... Does it move you? X&Y Has moved me like no other album since... well since, A Rush of Blood to the Head. ;) I definitley reccomend it!\u2026 Expand",

'Square One' is IMHO the best opening to any Coldplay album to date and 'White Shadows' has a great chorus and rhythm to it. 'Kingdom Come' is by far my biggest surprise on this album though. I didn't think that Coldplay had the ability or desire to play some thing with such bluegrass/country roots. Should have been a main track and not hidden. XY isn't any better/worse than Rush of Blood. The different approach taken on most songs works for me and serves as a nice change of pace from Rush of Blood. I do understand some negative reviews based on lyrical content (Martin isn't exactly a lyrical whiz-kid) but lyrics are typically so personal that there are bound to be people for whom some lyrics just dont work. Nice to see that Coldplay made a stronger attempt to get away from the standard verse, chorus, verse format of most songs for this album. Look forward to hearing the songs performed live to see if there is a different sound to be gained from some of the songs i didn't like as much e.g. Twisted Logic and A Message.\u2026 Expand",

The band got into trouble because of the use of the word \"Swastika\" in Xtrmntr and their alleged use of the Nazi salute and reference to getting rid of Israel during a concert in Glasgow. We might not listen to music because of themes and views. If so, leave these guys alone. But if you can get by what appear to be two incidents, you will not be unhappy that you add these guys to your list of great bands.\u2026 Expand",

Musically, it\u2019s also a representation of that, where the tone goes from sexy to scary within seconds of each other. The closest Ghersi\u2019s chopped, screwed, and consistently inconsistent songs can come to lead single material is the reggaet\u00f3n of \u201cThievery\u201d, which is sort of an accessible introduction into Xen as a whole and, thanks to the music video, very well belongs to the most luxurious strip club in your city. Even within its experimentation, Xen invites you in with its artsiest moments\u2014the metallic and synth soaked title track and, according to Ghersi, the most personal one on Xen, \u201cFailed\u201d, which is about his current boyfriend. The cold and claustrophobic nature of Xen can be an uncompromising experience for listeners expecting more musical versatility and instrumentation, coming off as dull. But for anyone who gives it a closer examination can hear the heart beating behind these beats and as it continues to pull you in, the realization that Ghersi has made one of the most mood-altering and sonically distinguishable records in electronic music comes kicking in even closer.\r Overall rating: 8.6\r Highlights: \"Xen\", \"Sad **** \"Sisters\", \"Thievery\", \"Failed\"\u2026 Expand",

I can actually hear it in his voice, he\u2019s not just saying he loves his girl, you can actually hear the passion and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a standout song for me.\r Definitely ends the album on a high note.\r Overall X the album has some great songs, some average ones, and some lousy ones.

The track swirls with guitar riffs and heavy beats throughout with verses and chorus sung in a gorgeously outstanding melisma and falsetto. Both production and vocals, makes one reminisce on a Timberlake and even Michael Jackson.\r \"Don't\" is basically the guys anthem for women being disloyal and unfaithful with you, but deeper to the story, it is his feelings pouring out after that his fellow-celebrity crush and lover went behind his sight with another man. And who the girl is *cough, Ellie Goulding?, cough* we may never know.\rThe song is the closest thing a singer/song-writer is coming to 2 Pac's \"California Love\" and Blackstreet's \"No Diggity\". Two tracks Dr. Dre did what he's known for, outside of his Beats-collection, and on here the bounce infectiously got a wrap on what could, or should be Sheeran's next single. A track Sheeran has been open about the influence of.\r \"All my senses come to life / While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I, have ever been..\" he sings shattered and lonely for some warmth on the opener \"One\", as he slowly realises that his woman slips out of reach for the days that goes by.\rAn absolutely beautiful song, that starts up with him and his acoustic guitar then with adds of a light beat-kick and orchestral melodics. The second chorus in, switches to that he knows, she is being lossed, but hopes at least for her to stay in friendship even if they don't share the same ammount of love. Where this all had it's chance to go Disney, it felt fresh and quite crushing.\rWhile his precursor \"+\" shared the topics a like, the execution mostly had it's lacks, if it was a corny lyric or just a weak production, it had it's critics, it was recognized by myself to, but for this run you actually feel the emotions and don't feel the need to cringe instead. Sheeran is putting a closure to the same girl he had mentioned on \"+\", end chapter, good mate. This will probably be the most played for the rainy days, a song that will top at the back-hand of the year.\r The album is a change pace for Sheeran, more than before, he embraces influences from other artists and genres, like The Streets influenced cut \"The Man\" where he raps excellent with a sing-songy flow, or if it is just a sting of touch of a rapidly vocal output of Craig David. His love for Hip Hop is all over, especially the first half which also is the stronger and more memorable part. Though all the songs might not have the fire as the six opening tracks, they still got a little charm in them without being that much of a filler.\r Ed Sheeran is out this time, with a broader purpose to stay, there lyrics, melodies don't end up beeing the cheesy teen-pop, high school poetry, but, noticeably grown as an artist. He his writing more cohesive, sexier and taking his music further bringing another element to it which could have failed to his right, but ended up being the most satisfying album he has done, proven me his talents and that some mistakes, just was mistakes.\r \"Multiply\" as pronounced, is one of the best mainstream pop music we are going to across this year, and one of the better ones in a while!\u2026 Expand",

Essas coisas, ent\u00e3o, devem ser mais bem mostradas no \u00e1lbum seguinte para que o p\u00fablico saiba qual o verdadeiro artista est\u00e1 na sua frente. Ent\u00e3o, o segundo \u00e1lbum \u00e9 o consolidador (ou n\u00e3o) da carreira de um artista. Claro, h\u00e1 v\u00e1rias exce\u00e7\u00f5es, mas, em v\u00e1rios casos acontece assim. O mais recente exemplo \u00e9 do ingl\u00eas Ed Sheeran. Para a alegria de Ed, seus f\u00e3s e do p\u00fablico em geral, o resultado de X (fala-se multiply, \"multiplica\u00e7\u00e3o\") o resultado \u00e9 positivo. Melhor: o resultado \u00e9 extremamente positivo, pois Ed, al\u00e9m de se mostrar um artista mais complexo que seu trabalho anterior, entrega um CD sensacional.\r X funciona espetacularmente em todos os n\u00edveis poss\u00edveis. Come\u00e7a pelo fato de que o CD \u00e9 deliciosamente despretensioso. Ed \u00e9 um jovem de 23 anos que est\u00e1 \u00e0 procura de um caminho em sua vida pessoa e devido a isso encontra no caminho obst\u00e1culos, comete erros e, as vezes, acerta. Mais do que isso: Ed quer apenas viver sua vida. Encontrar um sentido na sua exist\u00eancia. Como eu, voc\u00ea e todo mundo. Essa humanidade \u00e9 percept\u00edvel em cada composi\u00e7\u00e3o que comp\u00f5em X dando ao trabalho uma atmosfera t\u00e3o toc\u00e1vel e identific\u00e1vel. S\u00e3o as mem\u00f3rias, as viv\u00eancias, as observa\u00e7\u00f5es de Ed sobre a vida. Com uma prefer\u00eancia para os assuntos do cora\u00e7\u00e3o, mas sem esquecer outras facetas e tamb\u00e9m utilizando em alguns momentos pitadas do humor e a ironia t\u00edpica brit\u00e2nica, Ed demonstra uma habilidade para narrar as coisas banais com uma do\u00e7ura \u00fanica, mas sem perder o foco e cair em lugares comuns. Na verdade, Ed com ajuda de alguns parceiros interessantes se faz um expert em contar de maneira o que \u00e9 de comum na vida de uma pessoa. Como um verdadeiro cantor/compositor, Ed domina suas can\u00e7\u00f5es com perfei\u00e7\u00e3o. Por\u00e9m, nada pode preparar quem ouve todo o \u00e1lbum para a impressionante presen\u00e7a e versatilidade que ele mostra aqui.\r Dono de um tom delicado e suave como seda, o cantor n\u00e3o se apega a isso para fazer as suas performances. Ed mostra uma capacidade impressionante no que tange se adaptar em diversos estilos para melhor interpretada cada can\u00e7\u00e3o de X. Ele se coloca na figura de cantor de pop estilo \"Michael Jackson\" com a mesma facilidade que tem para se modular na figura de cantor indie pop mostrando uma fragilidade emocionante. Ent\u00e3o, Ed vira um rapper com um estilo divertido e afiado para depois carregar brilhantemente uma power balada pop sem nenhum momento perder as qualidades de sua voz. Finalmente, mas n\u00e3o menos importantes, as escolhas de Ed para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00e1lbum s\u00e3o acertada no momento que ele decidiu abrir o leque de possibilidades com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de novos nomes como Pharrell Williams, Rick Rubin, Jeff Bhasker e Emile Haynie dando para a sua sonoridade um colorido mais vibrante e bem mais subst\u00e2ncia do que apenas trabalhar com Jake Gosling (produtor do anterior +), mas que tamb\u00e9m aqui tem seu nome credito em algumas m\u00fasicas. N\u00e3o que essas mudan\u00e7as mudaram o estilo pop indie com base de viol\u00e3o e influ\u00eancias de R&B, folk e rock que Ed mostrou anteriormente, mas com a ajuda deles a sonoridade ficou mais refinada e intensa. O resultado final \u00e9 um \u00e1lbum inspirado e bastante coeso que ajuda a mostrar claramente quem \u00e9 Ed Sheeran. Entre v\u00e1rios momentos marcantes em X \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio destacar que o melhor momento \u00e9 a emocionante Photograph, uma balada capaz de tirar l\u00e1grimas verdadeiras. N\u00e3o menos sensacionais est\u00e3o One, o single Sing, as com uma orienta\u00e7\u00e3o mais voltada para o rap The Man e Take It Back, Thinking Out Loud que lembra muito as can\u00e7\u00f5es de John Mayer e, por fim, a bonita Afire Love. Ed Sheeran tem como o resultado de X, n\u00e3o apenas um dos melhores \u00e1lbuns de 2014, mas o come\u00e7o definitivo de uma carreira que vai ainda dar frutos ainda mais impressionantes.\u2026 Expand",

From the first lyric until the last one, Sheeran performs so flawlessly you can literally feel his pain, agony, happiness, love, or confusion. Here's a track-by-track review:\r1. One: No other track could have kicked off the album so beautifully, with Sheeran desperately asking a former lover to \"always be a friend\". My personnel favourite.(10/10)\r2. I'm a Mess: Great track with some great guitar riffs, and the last minute and a half will blow you away with Sheeran repeating \"For how long I loved my lover?\". A huge concert-bomb, this track is.(10/10)\r3. Sing: The lead single off of the record and the Pharell-driven Timberlak\"ish\" track is easily a stand-out, specially due to Sheeran's flawless falsetto.(10/10)\r4. Don't: A blue-eyed pop/hip-hop hit about a cheating flame. Obviously, a huge future-single choice. This track says \"Rick Rubin\" all over it.(10/10)\r5. Nina: A track about Sheeran and his former lover \"watching DVD and smoking illegal weed\", but finally he asks her to leave cause he'll never stop touring. Good one, but not the best one. (8/10)\r6. Photograph: There are no words to describe this, as many said, Snow Patrol-meets-Taylor Swift ballad. Just like Ed said it would, this track is gonna \"change the path of his career\". I would give it an 11 if i could. (10/10)\r7. Bloodstream: A bit clich\u00e9d, but the song is saved by 3 elements: Ed's soulful vocally-beautiful performance, Ed's perfectly executed guitar-riffs, and the obvious imprint of Rick Rubin on it. (9/10)\r8. Tenerife Sea: I'd be a liar if I said this track is not a great love weeding-ready song. One of those songs that says what every girl wants to hear. (9/10)\r9. Runaway: If this song doesn't become a huge hit and beautiful stop in concert, then I don't wanna live anymore. Once again, this great Pharrell-Timberlake song also says \"ED SHEEEEERAN\" all over it. He's not trying too hard, it just comes naturally. (10/10)\r10. The Man: If you missed the Streets you saw on You Need Me, I Don't Need You, well here we go back to his great rap, but about a different concept: heartbreak and the loss of an old flame. Flawlessly-done.(9/10)\r11. Thinking Out Loud: probably the biggest track on the album, along with Photograph. Great performance, great vocals, great instruments, great lyrics, great production. GREAT GREAT GREAT. (10/10)\r12. Afire Love: While his debut single was about a drug-addict prostitute, this one is about Alzheimer's and his grandpa's struggle with it. Yep, this is how much Ed's lyrics are diverse. Great heartbreaking closer.(9/10)\rSo that about sums up the whole concept of the Brit's sophomore installment: You're Happy? Listen to it. You're sad and confused? Listen to it. Ed Sheeran just shows us just how far his talent can go. BUY IT PEOPLE!!\u2026 Expand",

The talent is obvious but as long as he allows his albums to venture away from his selling point it seems that he will always underwhelm to some extent. However, lyrically he has vastly improved in my opinion, where the more forgettable tracks of \"+\" lacked in the substance of the stand out tracks, it is very much strong across the board this time. (I won't put any in to prevent spoiling for first time listeners!)\r So basically, he has put out a good album which for most we would probably be impressed with, but this is Ed Sheeran, a man of enormous talent if only it could be channelled better.\u2026 Expand",

It\u2019s an improvement over + with its more diverse music while still retaining Sheeran\u2019s gift of lyric writing. While this problem is lesser here as it was in his previous work, some of Sheeran\u2019s songs in x still sound a little similar. Further, I like how Sheeran keeps his profanity bleeps musical, but it gets annoying how often he uses the same type of bleep. I almost would have preferred if he kept that language in his song Don\u2019t, since I feel like it would be deserved in that context, as Sheeran feels really angry about lost love and how she treated him poorly. There are so many beautiful songs on Multiply, but the standout to me is Photograph, which could not have been a better song and it is one of my absolute favorites of all time. Ed Sheeran obviously took a lot of time and effort working on x, and it really paid off. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves great music.

Most of the other songs are slow, sad love songs and sound very similar to each other. Still, there is great passion in Sheeran's voice, and this album is okay.",

But he is oozing with personality, humor, wit and compassion. The production is minimalistic for the most part and it kinda reminds me of Lil B's style of production. But Danny sounds right at home on some of these songs like I Will, Radio Song, Lie4, Outer Space and Monopoly. These songs don't rely on MBDTF style production to get a reaction out of you. They rely on Danny's lyrics to convey the message. And what's the message exactly on this album? Basically, that Danny Brown is a 30-year old, drug abusing weirdo. But once the song DNA hits, the album turns a new leaf, Danny is rapping in a much more quiet voice and he talks about how his drug abuse has been herreditary and that it runs in the bloodline. The next few songs have him rapping in that voice and a lot more somber production. The last song has him rapping in his higher pitch where he's pretty much having a meltdown, he's taking more pills and trying to OD. That's how crazy it is, Danny Brown isn't really glorifying drugs in the same way Lil Wayne glorifies codeine. He just says that this is part of his life and he has no choice but to act that way. This album is funny, witty, tragic, strange and overall a blast to listen to. My only gripe is that the middle kind of drags a bit. But overall, this album is great. And totally worth looking into.\u2026 Expand",

Brown has a few memorable lines throughout. Ironically I can only remember one at the moment; \"you've got no clue like a toy store without board games\". Maybe not the most impressive wordplay ever but it highlights the Adderal Admiral's weird personality. I don't know wether I love it because of the fact it's a concept album or because of how unique he sounds or because of any number of reasons but I find myself returning to it on a daily basis.\rImprovement On Previous Project?: I haven't heard itv\rTry This If You Like: CLPPNG by clipping.\u2026 Expand",

Ou \u00e9 apenas o que as pessoas que produziram acham sobre o que seria a sonoridade desse artista? Essa \u00e9 a indaga\u00e7\u00e3o que me debato ao ficar de frente com o segundo\r\u00e1lbum p\u00f3stumo do cara que ajudou a modelar a m\u00fasica atual: Michael Jackson.\r Xscape \u00e9 uma compila\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rias demos, algumas inclusive previamente \"vazadas\" na internet, reformuladas por um time do escal\u00e3o A da m\u00fasica contempor\u00e2nea americana como Timbaland, StarGate, Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon e Rodney Jerkins que est\u00e3o por tr\u00e1s dos mais sucessos recentes como Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Lady GaGa e outros, ou seja, a nova corte do pop. Sendo assim, esse povo seria a produ\u00e7\u00e3o que Michael escolheria para produzir seu \u00e1lbum? Acho que sim, pois Michel apenas trabalhava com os melhores. E a sonoridade final de Xscape seria a que o Rei do Pop entregaria para o mundo? Talvez n\u00e3o, mas o que ouvimos aqui est\u00e1 no caminho certo. Aqui n\u00e3o \u00e9 feito nada al\u00e9m do bom R&B/pop que nomes como Timberlake e Usher fazem que, por sua vez, sofreram e sofrem grandes influ\u00eancias do pr\u00f3prio Michael. A moderniza\u00e7\u00e3o das demos s\u00e3o muito bem feitas, pois conseguem manter o espirito que MC queria passar, mas atualiza sem grandes deslizes e como gratas surpresas como a \u00f3tima Slave To The Rhythm, que talvez seja a mais pr\u00f3xima do que se poderia esperar do Michael. Mesmo lembrando cl\u00e1ssicos como Smooth Criminal e Dirty Diana, a faixa \u00e9 um dos momentos em que podemos sentir de fato a presen\u00e7a do cantor em Xscape. Como disse anteriormente, o single Love Never Felt So Good \u00e9 outro momento de qualidade em que viajamos no tempo.\r Enquanto as composi\u00e7\u00f5es, Xscape n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o refinado como poderia ser j\u00e1 que Michael nunca pode \"refinar\" o seu trabalho original. Mesmo entre altos e baixos \u00e9 poss\u00edvel de ver aqueles momentos de genialidade criativa dele como na boa A Place With No Name e na legal Blue Gangsta, al\u00e9m das j\u00e1 can\u00e7\u00f5es citadas. O problema aqui s\u00e3o as qualidade dos vocais de Michael: dependendo mais da qualidade das demos originais e em qual per\u00edodo a can\u00e7\u00e3o foi gravada originalmente, as faixas s\u00e3o uma verdadeira montanha-russa em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a qualidade vocal. O melhor exemplo \u00e9 Do You Know Where Your Children Are que tem vocais esquisitos e que nem parecem ter a presen\u00e7a do cantor, mas j\u00e1 nos versos a voz do cantor parece ter sido gravada na fase mais \u00e1urea da cantor. J\u00e1 Loving You tem certos momentos que parece que quem canta \u00e9 uma pessoa imitando Michael mesmo sendo uma can\u00e7\u00e3o boa. A can\u00e7\u00e3o mais fraca \u00e9 a mediana Xscape que d\u00e1 nome ao \u00e1lbum que n\u00e3o consegue engrenar em nenhum momento. Nada vai fazer Michael Jackson voltar a vida e nunca saberemos o que mais ele tinha para mostrar, mas, ao menos, Xscape \u00e9 decente e digno com o talento do Rei do Pop.\u2026 Expand",

Here's my take: even if it wasn't up to par, anything that Jackson discarded is probably better than 80% of pop music today; I also relish the opportunity at being able to see the inner workings of Jackson's musical mind.  For the most part, this is a pretty decent set.  \"Love Never Felt So Good\" (both the solo and JT duet) is a standout track, including \"Slave to the Rhythm\" and \"Do You Know Where Your Children Are.\"  The breezy, relaxed vibe of \"Loving You\" wouldn't sound out of place on today's Top 40, and \"Chicago\" makes use of present trends with the drum machine.  While I wasn't thrilled about paying extra to purchase the deluxe version of the album (with the original demo tracks), I appreciate their inclusion, to hear what sort of musical adventure Jackson might have taken us on.  Timbaland's production is strong without being smothering, and sounds relevant, reaching conclusions that Jackson himself might have reached.\u2026 Expand",

The video of Love never felt so good is the best of the best and quite resembles to MJ's Black orAlmost all the tracks are awesome.  Most entertaining songs with variety of genres.

The 8 songs on this posthumous album were recorded from 1983 to 1999. The songs were given a modern production by producers like Timbaland, Rodney Jerkins and StarGate. If you buy the deluxe edition of the album, you even get the original versions of the songs which were all (except for \"Slave to the Rhythm\") [co-]produced by Michael himself and another new version of \"Love Never Felt So Good\" featuring Justin Timberlake. What I love about this album is that it doesn\u2019t try to force a modern sound on Michael like his estate did for the biggest part with his first posthumous album \"Michael\" (2010). Timbaland and the other producers said they thought about what Michael would do if he would\u2019ve been in the studio with them. And I truly believe that this is exactly what an MJ album in 2014 would\u2019ve sounded like. It does have a modern sound but it fits him and it still sounds like Michael. The producers must\u2019ve put a lot of thought into this album, which is great and very respectful. As most of his songs that he released during his lifetime, the majority of the tracks addresses serious issues such as child abuse for example (\"Do You Know Where Your Children Are?\").The original versions of the album are of course very good as well (they were produced by the King duh). You do realize why MJ didn\u2019t release them as some of them sound like they are still in early demo stages. The original version of the title track sounds very finished though and is the best of the original versions. You can tell when he recorded these songs without having to look it up on the internet as they all sound like products of their time. \"XSCAPE\" was a great project. It respects MJ as an artist and gives fans an idea of what he could\u2019ve sounded like these days. I\u2018m gonna give only 9 instead of 10 points though, as \"Loving You\" is an annoying song (in both versions) and because I\u2018m not totally okay with his estate still using him for money. RIP, King. Favorites: A Place With No Name, Slave to the Rhythm & Xscape\u2026 Expand",
