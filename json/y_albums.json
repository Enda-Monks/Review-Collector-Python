Smart to an extent, as the album sometimes feels like a fleshed out compilation of these two releases.\r \"Red Morning Light\" (the album's first single) is a strong indication of what is to come, opening the album with bravado. The flesh carries us to \"Wasted Time,\" (single #3) a short little rocker with a grimy edge. The only special moment barring the EP backbone comes with \"Trani,\" a slow and reflective track with lots of soul. \"California Waiting\" and \"Molly's Chambers\" (singles #2 & 4 respectively) round out the framework of Youth & Young Manhood, and prove to be the two most memorable pieces on the record.\r Divorced from the strong backbone taken from the bands first two EP releases, Youth & Young Manhood would prove itself unmemorable and pudgy. Luckily, we are able to look back on an entertaining, quirky and memorable release from Kings of Leon - without the slight commercial tinge seen on their latter releases.\r Crazy and undeniably southern, here is a debut that is surprisingly worthwhile thanks to a powerful stable of well written garage rock hits.\r Track Picks: || Red Morning Light || Wasted Time || Trani || California Waiting || Molly's Chambers||\u2026 Expand",

As cliche as it sounds, this was supposed to be Coheed and Cambria's love-letter to their fans and in essence; their magnum opus.  Highly talked about before its release, the hype not only got me researching and anticipating; I also pre-ordered it to boot.  The album is as technical as it gets, with songs like 'Guns of Summer' making any fan of prog have weak knees.  The guitar work is great, and the drumming is sufficient; but the bass seems flat more often than not.  The technicality that is on display draws from what the album truly is, a flawed piece of work that is equally uneventful as it is impressive.  Now, not to say that the entire album is bad.  Songs like 'Here We Are Juggernaut' and 'World of Lines' are possibly some of the best prog songs to come out this decade.  But, most of the album slips into limbo, and follows the track of being repetitive.  Time and time again, an album hits that blinds with technicality; while slipping through with an unimaginative experience that will likely turn fans away.  'Year of the Black Rainbow' tries too hard, and falls short of greatness.\u2026 Expand",

Musically it's all fairly pedantic prog-rock intertwined with vague and slightly touching love songs, nothing astounding instrumentally. Fair enough. Taken into context with the story, though, and fleshed out with the accompanying book, this album still very much works for me. Many reviewers describe a rather \"dark and dreary\" overtone, and I'll agree. However, it's only because the story is so. Rife with tragedy and grief, the tale sets the stage for SSTB and the Amory Wars in general. As an album alone, it's only fairly good. I'm writing this review in context, as the album plays a crucial role in the rest of Coheed and Cambria's epic tale. Reader, keep an open mind. Follow along with the book. As a whole, you'll find something special here.\r Then move on to the Afterman Saga, and be completely blown away.\u2026 Expand",

The question being: where does Moz fit in to all this? QuiteAfter a seven year gap between studio albums, one may be forgiven for thinking that Morrissey is no longer relevant in the music industry of today. Times have changed and we have seen the rise and fall of various musical trends such as the end of Britpop and the rise of art rock in the form of bands such as Franz Ferdinand. The question being: where does Moz fit in to all this? Quite frankly, he doesn't and this is partially the reason as to why this album is such a joy from start to finish. I would argue that no-one with such a large audience speaks so freely and truthfully.\rI am reviewing this 8 years after release having only discovered it in the past year (I know, a little slow on the uptake). However, with the benefit of hindsight, I can say that this album ranks up with Morrissey's finest e.g. Your Arsenal, Vauxhall And I. This is perhaps because the songs on the album have been tried and tested to live audiences for years now. Lyrically, the album very much resembles the cover shot of Moz standing alone, pin-striped, guns loaded. Here, he takes on everyone from America, Tories, the Labour Party and my personal favourite slamming of \"lock-jawed pop stars, thicker than pig sh*t\".\rAt first the production may seem a little odd and I do think that it does become somewhat overbearing on some tracks that can really stand for themselves such as the albums opener \"America Is Not The World\" but this is only a minor gripe.\rThe albums true highlights are the singles \"Irish Blood, English Heart\", \"First Of The Gang To Die\" and the beautiful melodies and vocal acrobatics of \"Come Back To Camden\" and \"Let Me Kiss You\". But I suspect that the true Morrissey fans will be happy to hear that the Morrissey of old with his smooth wit and dark imagery is back and present in such tracks as \"This World Is Full Of Crashing Bores\" which in particular has a wonderful social and cultural commentary as well as the emotional and personal song \"How Could Anybody Possibly Know How I Feel?\". And this is where Morrissey succeeds the most, in the way that he can both shock (\"I Have Forgiven Jesus\"), provide an intelligent and familiar view on modern day popular culture as well as giving the audience a rich variety of emotions that he/she will be able to connect with. In conclusion, Morrissey has returned on form and has surpassed expectations. While the production by Jerry Finn leaves a bit to be desired, it doesn't detract from the brilliance of the vocal melodies nor the witty and insightful lyrics created by the man himself. This album rocks harder than Vauxhall And I but has a fairly similar sound without being as safe as that album was. All in all, one of the fine comeback albums of the 2000's and I cannot recommend this enough.\u2026 Expand",

I have seen many slam the whole so called \"viral marketing \" and lyrics but, i think if your just reading the lyrics a lot of songs might not seem that good...just listen to them with the music and it changes into something much better. And for the marketing, i think it was brilliant. A story that fans could investigate and draw their own conclusions about...something that as far as i know was unlike marketing altogether. If i am coerrect it all started with a T-shirt that had many letters some of which stood out from the rest and simply said \"i am trying to beleive\" which led to an odd, mysterious website. Then fans finding a jumpdrive with a song on it in a bathroom after a NIN concert. All of this led to a \"marekting\" campaign that was not advertised but more hidden and mysterious. I dont think i have ever heard/seen anything like it and i loved the idea of it. Much cooler and more fun than seeing some ad on itunes or cdnow.com. I have been a fan since i first read the lyrics to TDS and found my musical interest expanding. WIth Teeth was not a bad album...maybe a liltte too mainstream for me but i dont see how people could bash that album and i really have no clue why The Fragile had such a seemigly poor reputation. Reznor makes me beleive that there really are some people that deseve to be called artist instead of your typical trend following radio friendly music salesman that most music nowadays seems to feel like. I'm just glad that we didnt have to wait several years for this album and i think thats another thing that shows how talented Reznor is...this album came out what...less than 2 years after With Teeth and i am sure the marketing took more time than the typical boring ad anyone else would have done. This album would likely scare away your average music listener with the abstract soundscapes but, i think it will be a treat for anyone who found With Teeth to be too mainstream sounding that you would expect from NIN.\u2026 Expand",

The first half of the album is full of wicked, spikey, delectible peices of NIN sounds - like broken glass mixed with macadmia nut ice-cream. In the middle of this album you have this track, The Warning, an incredibly spooky track which talks of a messianic alien. Very creepy X-Files. Nice. We are delivered from salvation not by the second coming but by a giant hand coming down from the sky. The second half of the album is more moody and brooding. The final track sounds very David Bowie IMO.\u2026 Expand",

With each repeated play-through the sounds between the lines of each song have slowly unfurled and I've become completely absorbed in this fictional future that is actually simply a slightly darker depiction of the current status of our world. For fans of the sound that Reznor has been crafting starting with the Fragile this CD should be highly recommended. For fans of the earlier era stuff that have disliked the sound of his more recent work, you may be less thrilled.\u2026 Expand",

Broken was the failure of that and The Downward Spiral is the end result. The Fragile and In response to Weston T's attack at this being a concept album, you are obviously not paying to anything outside of your own little head. Pretty Hate Machine was a concept album primarily about a system within society (be it humans, love, work, etc. Trent's smart enough to be ambiguous). Broken was the failure of that and The Downward Spiral is the end result. The Fragile and With Teeth are far more complex and \"sprawling\" but repeated listens are always enlightening if you pay attention. Now that Trent has released his least ambiguous album to date, people are making a big deal of it being a concept album, when in fact it may musically be the least interesting Nine Inch Nails concept album yet, just for the fact that every little detail is laid out to perfection through the brilliant Alternate Reality Game that coincided with the release of the album. The true lifeblood of NIN and the reason, i contend, for the hardcore cult following that will buy anything NIN releases is the ambiguity. You may think Closer is about sex, after listening to it in the context of The Downward Spiral however, it's quite obvious that it's a very, very negative song about how low one can truely get. That's not even the definitive meaning of the song and you may disagree, but that is what makes NIN great and important in a sick world of endlessly cliche manufactured \"rock stars.\" Instinctively, I tend to discredit every new NIN album as \"the one where he finally lost it\" but then i listen a few more times and it starts to make sense.. Now many years later, I still find new and interesting things in every Nine Inch Nails album, no matter how many times i've heard them and that, I can assure you, is no accident.\u2026 Expand",

What If you are looking for the Frogstomp band of yesteryear, look elsewhere. Rarely do bands progress so beautifully as this one. This album is everything I expected it to be after Diorama and Daniel John's Dissociatives project. Both of those albums are pure genius in completely different ways, and Young Modern manages to take elements of both and mix it to perfection here. What I've always loved about Silverchair is their ability to vividly portray the emotions and state of mind of those writing this music, specifically Daniel. Young Modern is wild, carefree, over the top, and at times very humorous. It's detailed, yet straight forward. It's the best they have to offer, right behind Diorama. Best of 07 in my opinion, and one of the best of the decade.\u2026 Expand",

The songs are so personal, so honest and so beautiful. The songwriting is immaculate , its just really good and there is not much else to say after that. The production is very memorable as well. All the songs are so interesting and i really wish more people heard the record. The instrumentation and the lyrics of I'll be the Sad Song are so sad and beautiful. Long Walk is a classic country song about a judgmental person and it oozes so much  character. Pawn Shop is another personal favorite of mine about a woman who is pawning her ring , leaving her marriage and going to another city. Its so descriptive and well written. Who You Thought i Was is a moving nostalgic song about wanting to become better for a lover after the relationship is already over. I hope she wins that damn Grammy. Bigger Boat is a very interesting song about being inclusive towards those you disagree with, (i think). Bad Car is yet another sad song about not wanting to let something go because you love it and you have so many memories with it, in this case a car. Who Broke Whose Heart is a beautiful song about trying to get to the bottom of the real reason of the end of a relationship, The lyrics are really great and its so relatable, The last two songs continue with the same theme of picking up the pieces and moving on from a terrible heartbreak. The album is so cohesive , capturing many different aspects of a heartbreak. Its so good\u2026 Expand",

I think that finally a real blend of modern styles has been accomplished. 'Never Catch me' shows that the african rhythms that inspired spirituals/jazz/hiphop/salsa/etc are still present and fresh in the flow that Kendrick uses, and throughout the album. Thundercat does an amazing job on the bass, he drops the hottest bass licks of the year, together with some nice harmonies that make up for an ethereal sound. Album closer \"The Protest\" dives into eternity like going to the sea with the Elves. The harmonic complexity and jazz chops of erratic post-bebop make it an enjoyable trip because it takes out the \"slowness\" of jazz construction , that isn't necessarily bad but on modern times it is important to keep the listeners attention because one-click and they are listening to another album. It's that idea of keeping fresh every 15 seconds that overwhelms the fact that this is a hard-to-get-into album and that there is only one catchy phrase all along (\"Sa you will never ever catch me, no\") , and still destroying pop-structure it finds its way into new listeners of his and makes people talk about it, and thats the magic of \"You're Dead!\".  If future is fair with FlyLo, this will be regarded as one of musics finest examples and a push-forward to the whole art. Hope his next record blends this with contemporary orchestral music, reggaeton/salsa/southamerican music, peruvian rhythms like land\u00f3, african fela-style, etc or that other artists continue this leap forward.\u2026 Expand",

Don't make the mistake of thinking that he stuffed them away though. He's simply made his roots evident in his leaves instead. This album is spilling over with melodies and jazzy runs that make his background ever-present while taking it easier on our rhythm-dependent ears.\rSome of the, at times, overwhelming sound effects were kept at bay, this time around, using them primarily as accentual flourishes instead of the music's focus. Instead his kept our ears focused on the beautiful instrumental runs as well as the occasional rap from several collaborators, including Snoop Dogg.\r Flying Lotus gives the impression this year that he's not only sticking to a signature sound but that he has mastered it.\u2026 Expand",

The entire experience does not fail to impress and is perfect for a car ride home or deep listening at home. Every sound seems so delicately crafted together into compositions that are out of this world. I would say that the only thing lacking on this album is the two tracks; 'Descent Into Madness' and 'The Boys Who Died In Their Sleep'. These two tracks are not bad, they're just a bit off-putting compared to the excellence of the rest of the album. My favourite tracks would have to be 'Dead Man's Tetris' and 'Ready err Not'. Overall, this album is definitely something I will continue to listen to for the rest of my life.\u2026 Expand",

Godspeed have reached the OK Computer syndrome, trying to follow what is universally accepted as near-perfect, groundbreaking work. This album is a distinct departure from the band's previous work, despite all the comments of a homogenous sound. Yanqui glistens with the feel of more than its nine players, creeping out of the woodwork like a full orchestra. There are no samples, and no drone interludes connecting the larger passages. Instead, the compositions are more ambitious, the notes more dissonant. This album is not about simple relief and beauty. Godspeed are more unsettled than ever (if thats possible) and their progressions have far less of the easy relief of past work. The payoff is unimaginably powerful. This album is to be read like novel, sat with and taken in. That could be said for all their work, and most Post-Rock, but it has NEVER been true like it is now. All that, and the glorious \"Motherfucker=Redeemer,\" which comprises tracks 4 and 5, could be the best work this band has ever done. In a very real sense, it was all leading here. \u2026 Expand",

But still elusive to the Japanese quartet has been the successful translation of their powerful and violently beautiful live performances to their recordings. Despite their albums' masterful subtleties and majestic walls Throughout their six-year career, MONO has ascended consistently in both popularity and critical acclaim, with record sales and live show attendance corresponding. But still elusive to the Japanese quartet has been the successful translation of their powerful and violently beautiful live performances to their recordings. Despite their albums' masterful subtleties and majestic walls of noise, the consensus has remained that their transcendent live show is simply incomparable. If there is any chance of breaking that spell, it lies in You Are There, without a doubt the prime contender to unite the live and recorded worlds of MONO. Once again captured to tape by Steve Albini at his Electrical Audio studios in Chicago, IL, the album extends the cinematic drama of 2003's Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined (also recorded by Albini), while surpassing the sinister heaviness of 2002's lauded One Step More and You Die. If Walking Cloud was a nuclear winter, then You Are There is the post-war rebirth; steeped in an ominous creation-via-destruction atmosphere not heard since Neurosis' landmark Enemy of the Sun defined the sound more than a decade ago. You Are There disproves the myth that an increased focus on intricate song structures and string arrangements comes at the expense of youthful energy and inspired aggression. With You Are There, MONO's representation of tragedy comes with an inherent joy, delivered with the hope that in all dark there is equal parts light. They're not heavy like Black Sabbath - they're heavy like Beethoven. Jeremy deVine /Temporary Residence Limited\u2026 Expand",

As far as the lyrics... well, you probably won't feel deeply challenged by them, but if you're anything like me they'll manage to lodge themselves in your heart pretty quickly. Mitchell has a way of unfurling the story of a song in perfect synchrony with her song structures; 'Dyin' Day' is reminiscent of \"The Wall\" from her Hadestown album, in that it slowly builds a powerful lyrical idea using repetitive but evolving call-and response verses. That song is a highlight. Others include the title track, whose restless, hungry hero evokes immediate sympathy, and \"Coming Down\", a quiet and wistfully sad little tune.\r I will say that beyond those songs, none of the others have really grabbed me in the two days I've had to listen to it, but that might be because I have tracks 2-4 more or less on repeat. In the end I suppose I have to recommend Hadestown over this. But the three songs I mentioned above are really great, and absolutely worth the sticker price.\u2026 Expand",

It's a wonder Trouser Press has managed to be included in the selection of reviews for this album, as the meat of the review places Ys in a context in which Newsom has never claimed to be: both the aftermath and revival of some long-gone, overthrown 70s movement. It should be noted that, quite ironically, Trouser Press's review of the album itself meanders into an almost entirely irrelevant music history before finally throwing down a biting adjective or two toward the actual album itself. But to those who are interested in seeing both the appealing and potentially repelling qualities of Ys, figure this: her voice is unusual and hard to down at first, but is nevertheless an endearingly contribution all its own to the emotions expressed in Ys. The lyrics are elaborate, but indirect, having - at times - an almost riddle-like quality to them. The orchestration ranges from quiet to largely theatrical. The album, to me, is ambitious and unpretentious, and demands its listener take an active role in unearthing its secrets, rather than passively watching it unravel all on its own.\u2026 Expand",

Listen to that voice! Since when did bad become good? Now, I'm all for pretentious artists (I'm a big fan of Sting), but only if they have TALENT in the first place! Yeah, she can pick on the harp pretty well, but that doesn't give her an excuse to mindlessly and badly warble lyrics that, while decent, don't flow well. I have no problem handling up to 20 minutes songs (Yes's And You and I is one of my fav. songs of all time), but that's because the music keeps you involved in those cases by changing its tone every few minutes, but here, the only thing that keeps me from going to sleep is Joanna's constant squeaking. I think that if an album plans to be successful, all the elements have to be present, and skipping one area ruins it. Sure, the harp and orchestra is pretty, but the melodies aren't involving enough. Unless you absolutely LOVE THEM TO DEATH, you won't remember any of them the next day. The lyrics are alright, but I'd take anything by Neil Peart over any of them. But her voice...that ruins the whole album for me. To be mean about it, she sounds like Scrooge McDuck lifting heavy things whist sucking helium. And the squeaks! Would it kill her to go get some voice lessons? When will peole get the friggin' modesty to not sing when they can't! *ahem* anyway, I really, REALLY dislike this album, and despite what everyone else tells me, I'll never change my name.

I myself purchased the album the day it came out and listened to it twice in a row, once reading the words, once picking out musical anomolies. Neither aspect of the album dissapointed me. It's hard to say wether Joanna has more skills as a harpist, songwriter or lyricist, but everything she produces in each aspect is captivating. Ys is personal, musically perfect and a huge step up for the formerly faun-like gentle creature that is Joanna. She tells us she has been changing with the years and her rise to fame in Sawdust and Diamonds saying, \"I wasn't born of a whistle, or milked from a thistle at twilight. No, I was all horns and thorns, sprung out folly-formed, knock-kneed and upright.\" Joanna is progressing as a writer, singer and person and it is certain she will continue to please current fans and gather new ones with each passing day.\u2026 Expand",

No wonder one needs a biohazard suit to listen to today's popular music when you've got scenester wanna-bes like Jann Wenner leading the band. I apologize for them all, Joanna. Everything about you is simply too far ahead of the curve for those simpletons to even begin to comprehend. You have graced the 'aughts with a strikingly close approximation to both Astral Weeks and \"Desolation Row\" (\"Sawdust and Diamonds\"), and predictably Rolling Stone slaps you with two stars.

It's stunning that at such a young age, she has succeeded in not only being an incredibly talented musician, but attacking a project this large while carving out her own unique style.

I was somewhat intrigued, but also rather offput. After giving it a long rest, I came back and listened to the song Emily, which for some reason decided to grab me and cling on for dear life. I found myself humming snippets of tune in the shower. The more I listened to it, the more I realized how much nuance there is in this music, and what seemed rambly before was actually a fully populated world of sound filled with interesting audio minutia. Eventually, I got used to the voice, and the other songs on this album grew on me, with the exception of Cosmia, which is the only misstep on the entire album.

Van Dyke Parks' stamp is readily obvious to anyone who has heard 'Orange Crate Art'. I was initially excited about the freak-folk scene when Devendra Banhart's Rejoicing In the Hands was my favorite album of 2004 but 'Ys' overtakes that record and will probably go down as the San Fransisco's most important moment since the last time freaky folkies congregated there. As far as the present is concerned, the scene is now impossible to ignore.

Newsom's Ys is undoubtedly one of the greatest albums of 2006, and the decade. Her poetical prowess is only matched by her stunning ability to weave syllables and rhymes through melodies so entrenching and harmonies so rich you find yourself blindly swept into her whimsical stories of triumph and tragedy. I am yet to hear another contemporary artist who matches Newsom's structural aptitude. From the beginning of Emily to the final notes sustained in Cosmia, Newsom controls the pacing and energy in every section of each song. The climax in Only Skin reigns as the best I have ever heard, not just because of the motion and harmony, but because it has been perfectly set up from the first 15 minutes of the song and the three songs before. Newsom's four albums as of 2018 have not only proven her understanding of all the wonderful inner workings of music but also solidified her place as one of the greatest artists of the 21st century thus far.\u2026 Expand",

Obviously they were trying to do something different than \"Winter Hymn\" and that is to be applauded but there is very little here that makes excites me like their previous stuff. I have listened to this album 5 times.\u2026 Expand",

There's nothing here in the same realms of beautiful despair as their first album. However, songs like 'Sex Changes' and 'Shores of California' (my favourites so far) are nonetheless catchy tracks with substantial and unusually frank lyrical subject matter: they stand independently from the first album and, in honesty, probably represent the only direction The Dresden Dolls could have taken after the intensity of the last record.

Well anyways, this album is incredible, as trite as that may sound. It is such a large expansion on their already stellar debut. First of all, Alex Kapranos really explores the capabilities of his vocals much mroe than the he did in their first album. The basics of the songs- the guitars and the drums- are much more prominent in the melodies and in the background and are also more detailed. The tracks never even brush repetetiveness or seem boring. This album is very complete, although it takes 2-3 listens to fully enjoy the album. You Could Have It So Much Better will establish Franz Ferdinand as one of the premiere bands in alternative rock without a doubt. The point is, you need to own this album. If for some reason you don't already, take my word for it and go spend some money on this amazing collection of sound. I definitely would not give a big 10 just because it got an 85, it just is that damn fantastique.\u2026 Expand",

Though there's still plenty of booty-shaking left. The current single \"Do You Want To\" might be the song that enbodies that the most. And then there are songs like \"The Fallen\". Opening with a riff that's so solid it will make you want to smack your mom's bottom and scream \"bitch!\" at her(even if you really really love your mum, like I do), it really rocks your socks. The song \"Eleanor Put Your Boots Back On\" shows another side of the band. It's a really nice, Beatle-esque song which shows that FF can do more than building songs with rythms which are tighter then a swiss clock. All in all it's a pretty diverse album which will appeal to even more listeners thatn their last.

Of course by being warmer I mean despite the angular discoish sound there is more instrumentation and even oooohs and aaaaahs that were completely absent from the debut. When leftball albums come out and have a major impact you have to be a bit wary of many critic elitists who tend to underrate the follow up albums to try and elevate the illusion of their knowledge on the subjec as if they were amember of some vanguard organization of newly aquired taste, see reviews of Gorillaz and Death Cab for Cutey for reference points. There is a heavy price to pay to hip critics when you pose on billboards(end sarcasm). As for the low stylus review, the author gave kelly osbourne's album an A- if you want an indicator to his \"taste\" or judgement in music criticism. As for the sound of the album, they sound even more like early Roxy Music than they did on their first album. And any \"professional critic\" who does not pick up on this all too obvious influence(heck they even dress the same) isn't worth two grains of salt as an expert on the subject. Not taking into accounts the slower ballads that sound sort of like Jonathan Richman singing with an agular semi-Paul McCarthiesque arrangement. Ultimately this album sounds like a cohesion of various 60's and 70's bands, not 80's bands. Also on an interesting side note, the lyrics are printed in the little sleeve booklet on what appears to be real notebook paper.\u2026 Expand",

Most all music this profound is complete indigestable to anyone but art snobs. That Young Machettes takes the Blood Brothers hydrocloric mix and make it receivable to the merely adventurous while retaining artistic freedom is hard to fathom. Young Machettes should go along side your copy of TV & the Radio's Return to Cookie Mountain and Destroyer's Rubies as the best cds as the year.\u2026 Expand",

Yes, this album is, in some ways, even artsier than \"Crimes\", which was very artsy when compared to their previous works. But honestly, this album is brilliant, simply brilliant. Their sound is constantly evolving, and \"Young Machetes\" meets a point that is expertly-written hardcore mixed with electronic background effects, pop/dance rhythms, jazzy basslines and piano/keyboard playing, and even world ambient (maracas and tambourines? Oh my!). Johnny Whitney now throws in some outstanding falsettos and piano solos, while Jordan Blilie continues to scowl on alongside his co-lead singer in one song, and then seductively croon in the next. Their voices complement each other wonderfully, whether both of them are screaming and yelping like dogs on speed, or singing together, or maybe a bit of both. But Blilie's low-pitched voice and Whitney's beyond-comprehensive high-pitched voice match brilliantly. Mark Gajadhar's drumming continues to get more complex, as does Morgan Henderson's bass playing (going from a jazz rhythm in one song to a frantic mash in the next) and Cody Votolato's guitar skills, which overall is more of a background soundscape for the rest of the action that is ensuing around him, but one that adds much depth to the music. One of the best albums of 2006, and definitely another outstanding piece of work from The Blood Brothers. Just amazing.\u2026 Expand",

El \u00e1lbum esta hecho para divertirse, disfrutar y los v\u00eddeos que ha sacado tocan diferentes temas de impacto social que ning\u00fan otro artista del genero y mucho menos uno tan grande se ha atrevido a mencionar. Este cuenta con muchas colaboraciones con nuevos cantantes, pero tambi\u00e9n viejos artistas del reggaeton hay canciones que son en colaboraci\u00f3n que son repetitivas ya que no tienen muchos cambios entre una y otra y este es un punto en contra de este \u00e1lbum. Demuestra mucha creatividad en el \u00e1lbum y esto es de admirar, es un proyecto con buenas ideas, y una mejor ejecuci\u00f3n que pone al artista en un buen nivel.\u2026 Expand",

Toxic and let me say fake masculinity, basic lyrics, repetitive sound, no reinvention and lyrics about substance abuse and women sexualitzation were very present in his early music. One thing that amazed by back then is that he never seemed comfortable singing those songs or collaborating with someone just because of his/her position in the top celebrity ranking. What I want to express is that he did not have the personality he has shown to have in YHLQMDLG. He now has a sign, a voice, an essence, something that makes him unique musically and personally talking. Something fresh and enjoyable within the reggeaton music industry: a feminist, political grown up man. I haven't seen anything like this since Residente to be honest. Although he is an amazing album we are here to talk about his latest release.\rTo be honest, YHLQMDLG is a generic album without reaching a point of bore. Bad Bunny has been experimenting with music by mixing reggaeton with bubblegum pop, indie and a massive sound table. The album introduces itself greatly and evolves into a very enjoyable record until track 12 when you start to think that maybe the ninth track is the same as the fourth. However, it keeps being a very entertaining album that could be played on loop without any problem. You relief when \"Safaera\" starts playing. This track is a massive twist in YHLQMDLG and is when the sound table comes in. A lot of special effects are introduced in this track without making it a hard to support/messy one. I personally think it is the best track on the album. Comparing it to a 16-hour long opera play, \"Safaera\" would be its intermediate, a point of change. After it, though, the album returns to the album unfortunately becomes generic again due to a bunch of collaborations that apport nothing new to the album. However (I repeat), the album keeps being very entertaining.\rIn conclusion, YHLQMDLG is a album that perfectly represents the freedom Bad Bunny now has within the reggeaton industry. Showing his true essence, feelings and thoughts, the album is an amusing trip into the Puerto Rican's stable mind that perhaps would have been greater if it hadn't been this long.\u2026 Expand",

Thankfully \"Yours Truly\" the debut album fro Grande proves to be a success with well written songs, great production value, and Outstanding Vocals from Grande herself. The album starts out with the single \"Honeymoon Avenue\" which has some similarities with Timberlake's opening track \"Pusher Love Girl\" mostly for it's Violin and Strings at the beginning. the first half is ballads that shine because Grande provides plenty of Depth to each track with her own signature style. The second half is more fun and meant to be taken lightly which is a different approach from most pop albums, but \"Yours Truly\" manages to pull off this scheme very well. There are a couple of problems, some songs in the middle drag on a little, also it's not a very thoughtful album, the messages here are mostly about young love, nothing more, nothing less. But still \"Yours Truly\" is one of the more enjoyable pop albums to come along in a while, and proves that Grande has the chops to pull everything off on her own.\u2026 Expand",

Pop songs are mostly just club-friendly with unchanging drums and similar lyrical content. These people are selling singles. No one cares about the quality of a whole album. With several pop songs reaching top of the charts, then you work is done. Congratulations to Rihanna and Katy Perry for that. When Mariah has number one hits in the 90's, at least Mariah has a golden voice and occasionally produced a great album like Daydream. It becomes rare to really enjoy a nice vocal performance from female artists these days.\r Finally we have Ariana to give us something fresh, classy and enjoyable. And the songs are memorable. The girls is selling an album, not singles. It is inevitable for people to compare Ariana to Mariah all the time. With the crazy vocals and Pop/R&B Diva-ish music style, Ariana is kind of what we all want as the new generation's Mariah Carey, without all the diva stuff. It will be interesting to see what Ariana Grande delivers us in the future. With the voice, the look and the heart she got, she'll go pretty far.\u2026 Expand",

However, after a few days, do you still fervently recall it? The party? The friend? Be honest; you wouldn't. That exactly sums up my feelings towards Yours Truly, a confident, well-produced throwback to 90's R&B with a little bit of doo-wop thrown into the mix for good measure. Whilst there's a few standout songs there (The Way, Baby I, Piano), the rest are agreeable, but nothing special, album fillers. However, there's an immense amount of heart and soul in there: the fact that Grande and her producers have been tweaking and singing and writing the songs as if their very lives depended on it is very prevalent. It left us expecting a great sophomore album. That didn't necessarily happen, the heart and soul replaced with a newly found corporate sheen and the R&B rhythms gone, and EDM beats instead sitting in its place. Ariana Grande has a fantastic voice, but both her first and second albums didn't reach their full potential. Here's hoping third time lucky, but now she's a stratospheric pop princess with worldwide hits like Problem or Break Free, corporate moguls who like to suck the life out of everything may prevail.\u2026 Expand",

Her voice other than her vocal range, is beautiful most of the time throughout the album and the rest of the time is showcasing in singing abilities. Her tone is lovely and her songs are very hearted with meaning but has a lot of energy in other tunes too. It's something I don't really find on mainstream done with such grace and balance, I feel very pleased listening to her variety of songs. It seems like very few people reviewed Ariana Grande's first album here. The initial excitement for her release is still there, even after My Everything era had a smashing success, the critically acclaimed Yours Truly might be the beloved favorite for her fans. And it might be her favorite too, because she is very identified with it, she wishes she lived in Honeymoon Avenue and has tattoed hearts on her body. This was a #1 album as well but the overall opinion was that she was very underlooked. She is the opposite now, a superstar viewed and regarded to high standards when it comes to about anything measurable that indicates success. She is considered a hit maker now but essentially Ariana Grande always wanted to make an R&B album, this will always be the foundation of her career, which I hope is very long lived. When people doubt her future or recent material, they can always check out Yours Truly, I think she could make anyone appreciate it and see how Ariana has a great place in music. As we can see she can be a full pop star or a very gifted R&B singer, there is no way she doesn't continue growing as an artist. And we can't settle for Yours Truly to be her best album. More great music please, Ariana. Come on\u2026 Expand",

Because of this, I decided to listen to Grande\u2019s music to really be able to compare the two. After just one album, I cannot do anything because that\u2019s just not enough to base comparisons on. However, I did find that Yours Truly, Ariana Grande\u2019s first album, only beats one of Swift\u2019s albums: the notorious \u201creputation\u201d, which I gave a score of 2.18, as it suffers from extensive use of generic drum kits and synths and the lyric quality deterioration (they had been so powerful in previous Taylor Swift albums). Now, back to Grande. Yours Truly suffers from the same musicality issue but puts autotune into the mix, which I am not a fan of. Despite this, Grande is able to make upbeat music that does a fair job of disguising these commonalities, so this issue isn\u2019t a big deal for most of the songs in this album. Specifically, I thought Popular Song was amazing, as I love the musical \u201cWicked\u201d and I was thrilled that they made a real song out of the musical\u2019s version, and other songs like Piano and Better Left Unsaid were great as well. That being said, I did have a bit of a problem with Right There. Right There simply uses too much autotune and has some weird rap riff thing that I wasn\u2019t a fan of, plus it uses some annoying drums. Besides some other minor issues, I had a pretty good time listening to what Ariana Grande had to offer, and I look forward to hearing more of her stuff. Highlights: Honeymoon Avenue, Tattooed Heart, Piano, Popular Song, and Better Left Unsaid.\u2026 Expand",

This album was inspired by her idols such as Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera and was meant to be a throwback to 90s R&B. The album opens with \"Honeymoon Avenue\" which has a nice intro and the song's entire production still sounds very fresh. Its outro was very unnecessary though.The album's second single \"Baby I\" is a very smooth mid-tempo R&B song. I love the horns in the background. Its chorus is a shameless rip-off of Mariah Carey's \"Secret Love\".\"Tattooed Heart\" has a doo-wop sound and is simply a beautiful ballad. Her vocals are incredible on this one. \"Daydreamin\u2018\" is another great song that has a very nice melody in my opinion. The album's lead single \"The Way\" featuring Mac Miller still sounds fresh today and I remember being obsessed with it when it was released. Also her high notes towards the end of the song are incredible. \"Almost Is Never Enough\" featuring Nathan Skyes is a beautiful piano ballad with great lyrics. It reminds me a lot of Whitney Houston. \"Popular Song\" featuring Mika is my guilty pleasure. It doesn\u2019t fit on this album but it\u2019s just a very fun pop tune to be honest. Of course the album has its weaknesses. \"Piano\" sounds very dated and messy. \"Lovin' It\" is a terrible song and in my opinion one of the worst songs of Ariana's entire discography. The album's final track \"Better Left Unsaid\" doesn\u2019t fit on this album...at all. It has a very VERY dated dance pop sound. Overall I think that \"Yours Truly\" is a solid debut album. I love its uniqueness. Which other 20 year old act, especially one that is tied to a Nickelodeon show, releases a debut album that pays tribute to 90s R&B? Especially in 2013 where EDM and dance pop where popular and done by literally everyone. This album definitely stood out and many of its songs still sound fresh today. Of course it has its weakness, its songs are not as strong as album tracks from \"Dangerous Woman\" or \"thank u, next\" but the debut is rarely ever an artist\u2019s strongest work. And it\u2019s still miles ahead of \"Sweetener\" lol.Favorites: The Way, Popular Song, Tattooed Heart & Honeymoon Avenue\u2026 Expand",

There's pop, there's a little bit of rock, there's country, there's folk... And you can actually find a connection to all of the sounds she has ever done (Bangerz, Dead Petz, Breakout...), so I don't get it why some people say that she disowns her previous works...\r Anyways, her vocals are A+, I actually get chills sometimes!! She did what she had to do, like always, and with this 11-track-album she truly showed her versatility. I think that although she still needs to improve a little bit in terms of lyrics, it's a very good thing that this is 100% self-written - it shows who she actually is RIGHT NOW and what she has been through in the latest two years. IT'S GENUINE and it's so so personal that sometimes you feel in her place! Besides all these things, I love that it is not that mainstream - the production, the arrangements, the instruments... Miley and Orel Yoel did an amazing job!\r Personal faves: She's Not Him (her voice is angelic and it hurts - literally), Bad Mood (it could be a huge hit), Malibu (classic already), Week Without You (so fresh!!), Thinkin' (it makes me wanna dance, could be a great single) and I Would Die For You (f* beautiful). OK... I LOVE THEM ALL!!\r Well... it is a masterpiece. I cannot stop listening to it! She just showed she is growing a lot as an artist and that she is here to stay! Give it a shot, without being biased, you won't regret it. To be honest, after listening to this bop, I FEEL SO MUCH YOUNGER NOW!! Hope it gets the recognition it deserves.\u2026 Expand",

Whatever she's singing about, the most beautiful thing about this pack of songs, is that they're all coming straight from her heart.\u2026 Expand",

Consisting of 11 simple songs, Miley collaborated with the musical polymath, Oren Yoel, who was the producer and instrumentalist on the album. Miley performed all of the vocals on ten of the songs, including the back-up vocals, as she nearly always does. Miley wrote all the lyrics herself except for \"Rainbowland,\" where she collaborated on both the writing and singing with her Godmother and country legend, Dolly Parton. Miley has given various explanations for the overarching theme of the album, including--as I said before-- getting in touch with one's inner child, the freedom before the onset of late-teen and early-adult angst. Another is that she sees some of it as speaking out against ageism and division, and with the hope of bringing people together. This is quite consistent with some remarks she's made on the political front ... seeking to unify through music, notwithstanding differences in opinions. she is pathologically authentic and preternaturally nice, wanting as much as anything to be liked by all and to like them in return.\r Some of the album shows anger or emotional turmoil resulting from episodes in Miley's life ... and in at least in one case, in the life of a friend. Listening closely, one will find influences of multiple genres throughout the album, but I think it can best be described as more classical, early rock or rockabilly in terms of overall orientation. To be sure, there are big strains of country ... but also hip hop, pop-rock, psychedelic, EDM, and alternative ... But it's Miley Cyrus most of all. That's important; and it's also the \"beauty part,\" as old timers in New York are wont to say. It has her sometimes idiosyncratic idiom, her Tennessee twang, and, characteristically, it's also part autobiography. It also has the infectious punctuations ... the yeahs, and the ohs, and the guttural exclamations, breaks, and hiccups that characterize her vocals. One of the things that makes her music outstanding to me is that I can listen to it over long periods. There are other great vocalists and artists that I can listen to, but usually for only a few songs before I need something else. Miley, like only a handful of others, is someone I can listen to for hours at a time without a break. This album makes one want to drive and drive in the car, like the old days with my eight track ... not stopping til it's over, going around the block just one more time until it is and before pulling into the garage.\r The overarching theme of the album is surely autobiographical ... and if it is not in completely accurate in its details, I suspect it depicts real emotions about real events, and it's intended to evince and evoke those feelings. It is mostly old fashioned countrified rock n roll (which, after all, is rooted in rhythm and blues, Gospel, and country), though filtered through the lens of some modern electronic wizardry, and with hints of hip hop and other genres throughout. It also puts the lie to the notion that she abandoned hip hop, by the way, which she neither said nor did , but was falsely accused of doing. She abandoned misogyny and objectification, and as a husband, brother, son, and the father of a girl, I am grateful for that.  While I have my favorites, and some pieces are better than others, it is as perfect as an album can be. Pertinent, authentic, and often enough, simply riveting.\r Here's the thing, folks. Miley Ray Cyrus is a formidable artist, one for this era and for eras to come.  Elvis is one of her musical heroes, and one can feel his influence throughout in the way she attacks the vocals and the visuals on video and stage.  I venture to say she is the natural heir to Elvis in presentation, perhaps more than any other artist in recent memory, and maybe ever. No male has pulled it off as well ... The King's chemistry is hard to describe, but there's a lot of it in this small package.  One of my friends referred to her as the musical lovechild of Elvis and Madonna. That seems quite apt to me. Lyrically, however, she has more in common with Lennon and Dylan. She has Elvis-like intonations and the charisma and revolutionary spirit of both Elvis and Madonna, who, I might add, were both castigated for a variety of reasons in their day, too, for not being good musically to being merely prurient. Those sages are dead and forgotten. Elvis and Madonna are secure.  I keep repeating this, but Miley Cyrus is only 24!  It is easy to forget how young she is given that she's been a public figure for a decade. But she came into her own just a few years ago. Lennon and McCartney were several years older when Sgt. Pepper's was released\u2026 Expand",

In fact, she went head to head with Miley Cyrus a few weeks ago when the former Hannah Montana released her sixth studio album, \u201cYounger Now\u201d. Even though the passionate love song \u201cMalibu\u201d was the perfect way to begin Miley\u2019s new era, the overall direction didn\u2019t play in her favor.\r Say goodbye to the sassy, audacious and sexual Miley Cyrus you remember from \u201cBangerz\u201d. Say also goodbye to the urban bops she delivered during that same era. Miley sets the record straight right from the first track: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of who I used to be\u201d, she sings during \u201cYounger Now\u201d, the album\u2019s first track. Of course she is not\u2026 After all, if it wasn\u2019t for all that craziness around her, Miley wouldn\u2019t have happened post Disney Channel. In fact, I believe that Miley Cyrus thought she became such a big name out of her previous era that she could come, sing country and just slay the charts as she once did. Well, that didn\u2019t work.\r In a big mixture between country and pop, Miley delivers in \u201cYounger Now\u201d her most personal record so far. Besides the title track and \u201cMalibu\u201d (dedicated to her current boyfriend), Miley sings about other sort of personal things for her. Her hippie roots are of course present in the record as she constantly discusses peace. That can be heard in the cute peaceful tune \u201cInspired\u201d, a song she dedicates to her father but that can be easily adapted to other circumstances or in \u201cRainbowland\u201d, a duet with Dolly Parton and possibly the worst song on the record. Slap me now but I really can\u2019t find Dolly\u2019s accent amusing and she speaks quite a lot during the song\u2026\r This mixture between Pop and Country can be heard throughout the entire record. There\u2019s obviously Pop and Country songs individually but many - \u201cYounger Now\u201d, \u201cWeek Without You\u201d or \u201cMiss You So Much\u201d - do share the trend. Thinking about it, I believe that the only real and pure country tune is the Dolly Parton duet. The beautiful and emotional \u201cI Would Die Without You\u201d represents the end of the album\u2019s first half and kicks its second part\u2026 Way more Pop and way less country.\r \u201cThinkin\u2019\u201d comes right after and it obviously contains the album\u2019s catchier chorus as she repeats words such as \u201cmuch\u201d, \u201c\u2018nuff\u201d or \u201ctouch\u201d quite a few times. Impossible not to sing along. On the other hand, in \u201cBad Mood\u201d, the production kicks in and Miley gets me confused as I thought her relationship was a fairytale. In it she says \u201cwe're held together just by a string\u201d and in the following track, \u201cLove Someone\u201d, she goes \u201cI'm kinda getting tired of dealing with all your stress\u201d. I am not sure what those are supposed to mean but I know the songs are quite flawless as she brings up her bad attitude.\r Before \u201cInspired\u201d, we still have \u201cShe\u2019s Not Him\u201d, one of the most interesting songs lyrically as Miley takes an approach to her pansexuality.\r The former Disney star has already announced she is not touring with this album. I am certain that there won\u2019t be any more hits coming from it. \u201cMalibu\u201d was and will keep on being the only single-worthy song off \u201cYounger Now\u201d. I guess we will all have to see the album sinking as a ship as there is basically no salvation. Nonetheless, I will be here waiting for a new era.\u2026 Expand",

Ringo may be slated as a poor singer when compared to the 3 other Beatles, but in such company he was always going to. If you compare this album to a lot of recent artists, he more than holds his own as a great musician AND vocalist. Thank you for a great Rock and Roll album Ringo!\u2026 Expand",

If 'Bottomless Pit' was the sequel to 'The Money Store', 'Year of The Snitch' would be the sequel to 'Government Plates'. However, this record is so much better than the electronic, repetitive nature of 'Government Plates'. Instead, it relieves the repetitive nature with a revered-punk aesthetic packed with scratching and intense psychedelic soundscapes that fill the room. It is not just a great album, rather, an experience. Each track leads onto the next cohesively and has been crafted in a way that is not too polarizing for new-comers but experimental enough to fulfill those already fans of 'Death Grips' music.\rMy favorite track would have to be 'Linda's In Custody' as it is impressive to see the group leaving their comfort zone for something more chilled out and ultimately a completely hypnotic experience. My least favorite track, 'Little Richard' unfortunately impacted the overall experience as the distorted lyrics sound cheap and crackly. However, every other track was awesome to some extent with 'The Fear' being another highlight in the album.\r'Year of The Snitch' is well deserving of a 9/10 and is sadly an underrated record that needs more attention.\u2026 Expand",

Well, you can\u2019t. Kanye West got subsequently worse after My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, with his Jay-Z collaboration Watch The Throne being more back to the roots, yet still awesome and his record\u2019s group album Cruel Summer being not much more than well-made fun for the summer with tons of prominent guests on it. His newest release Yeezus is anything but spectacular  just look at its cover. And if West\u2019s Saturday Night Live performance of \u2018New Slaves\u2019 and \u2018Black Skinhead\u2019 induced you to think that his much anticipated 6th studio album is completely different to his former releases, it\u2019s not either. He was clearly experimenting with beats when he made the album and some Daft Punk productions are quite unique in hip hop, admittedly; but his rap style, which is the topmost in a hip hop album, has stayed very similar to earlier releases. What is it then that still makes it a great album? It\u2019s actually the fact that it isn\u2019t anything new. The Chicago rapper mixes every single one of styles he had in his rap career into this album, meaning The College Dropout\u2019s and Late Registration\u2019s pun- and wordplay-laden lyrics, 808\u2019s & Heartbreak whining, poetic lyrics and Autotune effects, and MBDTF\u2019s epic atmosphere. And seriously, there isn\u2019t anything bad with that because there\u2019s something for everyone included in Yeezus: However, a bit more uniqueness wouldn\u2019t have derogated the record, that\u2019s for sure. Basically, the album may be disappointing just because it isn\u2019t as colossal as \u2018Ye\u2019s former  albums, but doesn\u2019t lack anything that would make it a great hip hop record. It should seamlessly fit in in your Yeezy CD collection at home and even if it may take some listens to get accustomed to it, you will like it eventually. Yeezus is an original, unconventional, and adventurous hip hop album like you\u2019ve never seen one before. He tries a lot of new things with his music and although he doesn\u2019t succeed every time, it\u2019s great fun to listen to his musical mixture of feelings. Just think of the majestic beats and Justin Vernon\u2019s grand guest parts  how can you not love that?\u2026 Expand",

Kanye placed the goal of innovation over the goal of making good music. The production has its moments, but slips too often into a rumbling synths, bassy buzzsaws, high-pitched metallic shrieks that overshadow what little lyrical element exists  but that's preferable to the hamfisted lyrics.\r Kanye may have abandoned catchy production and mass appeal, but his lyrics burned the bridge. Kanye has always been a juxtaposition, mixing the fragility and transparency of a glass champagne flute with the narcissism and braggadocio that is typical of hip hop. Kanye has fallen (or jumped) from this tight-wire balance, landing deep within the infinite void of his own ego. The lyrics are self-exalting, self-congratulatory and self-centered. On more than a few tracks, Kanye is battling old shadows with incendiary lyrics, responding to echos with a rebuttal to the choir  no one is arguing the point anymore, but Kanye continues to tantrum on; not with the witty lyrics of his past albums, but with brutish blusters, caterwaul screams, and childish yowls  laced with production cuts and reverb. And, when the time comes, Kanye delves into closet of hiphop's past and drags out the autotune to compliment his tired arguments.\r Kanye's flow ebbs due to a conscious decision to adopt the slow-paced percussive style of southern rappers that bounce over club bangers. Kanye's wavering confident self-aware delivery of the past that made his previous records so great is nowhere to be found, but is certainly missed.\r The media will, of course, gush over the emperor's new clothing, with words like 'brave' and 'genius', but it will only be lip service and mouthed praise. Deep down this isn't about His music, this is about Him as a concept, and idea, a brand. the media's love affair with Kanye was built on the foundation of quality music, but in the wake of countless spectacles of egotism, and displays of self-unawareness, supported by unearned comparisons have laid the brickwork to this taj mahall, Kanye mutters to a reporter, \"I am the best ever\" and those words migrate to the front of music magazines  and the world begins to echo back kanye's own praise, first framed as a question, but like all echos, the end trails off and the statement, \"Kanye is the best\" becomes a statement. And he has been the best, he has been really really good, but not this time, and no one will have the guts to tell the self-crowned emperor that he is naked.\r I applaud Kanye's vision and ambition to continually grow and change as an artist, but new isn't always better, and sometimes it's terrible. Kanye's music is lacking the soulful sweetness and depth that counteracts his acerbic ostentatiousness. I won't be buying this album, and I will certainly be more skeptical of any subsequent releases.\u2026 Expand",

If My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was his expression of celebrity and intimate feelings, then Yeezus is Kanye at the VMAs, telling Taylor Swift that Beyonce was better.  This album is Kanye screaming at the world, ego inflated, that whatever he does is a masterpiece because only HE can pull it off.\r Yeezus, the title, suggests this.  It's an obvious allusion to Jesus, who by the words of the Bible could do things others could not.  This is Yeezus.  It's Kanye doing what others can't.  He took a synth and turned it into a dark, grinding, acidic extension of his ego.\r However, this album isn't all dark grit and grind.  I personally think \"Bound 2\" belongs more on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in terms of stylistic qualities, but its beautiful sampling and clever lyrics will not be depricated in the slightest by being a part of this album.  It might be my favorite song Kanye has ever made, it's that good.\r If you have an open mind, you'll enjoy this album.  It takes two or three listens to really get a grasp on what Kanye was trying to do here; however, once this has been achieved, this album is brilliant in its own right.\r This isn't My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.  This is more ambitious, more egotistical, more narcissistic.  Not every can produce M.B.D.T.F. (a classic, mind you) every album.  This is about as close to a great repeat effort as one can be.

Those soulful, sped up samples that created his signature style. But then I went back and listened to College Dropout, Late Registration and Graduation....and then I went back and listened to Yeezus, and got this feeling...like Yeezus filled me with an energy that those past albums couldn't touch. Those were all great albums (I also really enjoyed 808 and MBDTF), but Yeezus is clearly in another league in terms of the emotion and feeling you receive from it.\r And this is where I realized that what separates Kanye from other artists, lets just use Jay Z as an example, is that Kanye is constantly pushing hip hop to new heights and barriers. While Jay Z plays the conservative route...giving people what they want to hear, Kanye gives people music that they didn't realize they wanted to hear. I remember a quote by Steve Jobs, when asked why Apple doesn't do a lot of consumer research (compared to Samsung, MSFT, etc...) and his reply was \"Because people don't know what they want\".\r I feel Kanye has the same approach. A creative innovator like Kanye isn't just going to give us an album of sped up samples like some want, because that's been done. He's going to keep giving us new music, and new perspectives on things. And I love it. I don't want 10 albums that sound all sound alike (blueprint 1, blueprint 2, etc..), I'd rather have 10 albums that all sound uniquely different in their own awesome way (Rubber Soul, Sgt Peppers, White album, etc...) wouldn't you?\u2026 Expand",

The sounds are immediately abrasive before becoming agreeable, immediately deprogramming any preconceived notion that this is a typical rap album.  It is here most hearers will be lost.  Listeners, however, are in for quite the ride, one that will forever change hip hop as we know it.\r I think now is a good time to inform the reader I was of the opinion that 808s and Heartbreaks was \"garbage Kanye\" and  The College Dropout was \"the real Kanye\", important to note.  This was a skeptic's ear to Yeezus.\r I imagine executive producer and hip hop pioneer Rick Rubin smiling a wry smile about an album like Yeezus years before it was created.  \"What if the most respected electronic producers worked with one of the biggest hip hop artists in the industry to create a multi-collaborative, minimalist album?\".  The idea was probably quickly brushed away by rational thoughts like \"Nah.  No one has the balls nor vision for that\" or \"Who the hell would do that?\"\r Enter Yeezus.  Sonically, it is 40+ minutes of caution to the wind.  The Chicago ties are well documented, the acid house and industrial genre influence apparent.  This has been done before in hip hop, and in fact, it could be argued this is a commercial adaptation of previous Saul Williams-Trent Reznor collaborations.  Yeezus separates itself in the nuances, though.  The first sample on the album comes at the 1:17 mark and says \"He'll give us what we need, may not be what we want\".  This is a fine tuned monster we're dealing with; an album that assumes a certain intelligence from its audience and does not apologize to those who do not understand\r Lyrically, this is quintessential Kanye.  The punch lines are abundant and raunchy, and making a welcome return are socially conscious lines about the prison industrial complex, corporate control and modern slavery.  And yes, there is such a thing.  Like crack, both the lines and drum patterns have been boiled down a highly flammable essence.  At its core, its just beats and rhymes.  This sole fact keeps it in the hip hop realm, somewhere, years away from being accepted.\r The album triumphs most when any confining parameters are shed.   Indeed, the very idea of God is shaken within the confines of Yeezus.  There is perhaps no better example on the album than \"Blood on the Leaves\", a song about the woe of an unwilling father which features a sample from Nina Simone's cover of Strange Fruit.  On paper is seems clever if not downright odd to sample a song about lynchings on a song about unwelcome borne fruit.  It is executed to near perfection, with TNGHT supplied arrangement reaching horn-apexed crescendos as Simone exclaims \"black bodies swingin in the summer breeze\".\r Many were(and are) caught up in the proclamation that Kanye West \"is a god\".  If that is the case, let them forever stay in ignorance of the Nation of the Five Percenters.  But I digress.  The son of a Black Panther, Mr. West is well versed in his heritage, or rather, the dehumanization of it.  Said West of the tittle of this project, \"West was my slave name.  Yeezus is my god name.\" Let us also gloss over the beliefs held by the major four religions and speak nothing of destiny in accordance with free will in godmind.  This is but an album review.  The track, however, again plays with an idea often attributed to Kanye.  How egotiscal he must be, unless of course, he is serious.  Any Youtube researcher can tell you West is a part of the globalist elite, the Illuminati, and the demonic yelling at the end of the track is only but further proof of devil worship.  Indeed he tells us on Black Skinhead \"I think I'm possessed, it's an omen\".  Whether you believe it to be literal or liberal, is your choice.\r West finally comprises on the last track, the sample driven Bound 2.  To me, it sticks out like a sore thumb and proves to be one of the worst on the album.  Worst being a relative term, of course.  It feels out of place, and instead of a traditional Kanye chop, its done in a looped style, which makes the track feel a bit busy and un-involved.  When considered in the body of work (the body of Yeezus, if you will), its almost a statement track.  Just because its what you might want to hear from Kanye doesn't mean its good, and just because Yeezus isn't necessarily what you want to hear from Kanye doesn't mean it isn't great.\r This album will change the way hip hop is accepted in the years to come.  I firmly hold that Yeezus will have Revolver like influence in the hip hop community and open doors both to new artists and different collaborates alike.  Ever the lane maker, Kanye West has once again opened the door for a new era of artist.  Yeezus is probably not the best work of this multiple Grammy award winner, but it will be his most influential, and for that, I applaud him.\u2026 Expand",

After his enormous success with the critically-lauded \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\" Kanye sought out to change his game yet again, repeatedly informing interviewers about him doing the complete opposite of what people wanted from him musically. Abrasive, pummeling, extreme, grinding, droney and industrial are all words I would use to describe the sound from this record, yet in the hands of a man with talent like Mr. West, the irritating noises soon begin to take shape, form, and end up becoming a masterpiece that the perfectionist is obsessively using to stay far, far ahead of the game. Remember when hip-hop was uncomfortable? When it was weird and unpleasant and jarring and crazy? That's exactly what this album is, constantly knocking you off of your feet, and as you stand up to brush the dust off, hits you yet again. Ye also stated that he wanted a minimalist design to the record, and it is very much so; clocking in at 40 minutes, there's no beat or noise or scream that isn't perfectly in place. Also treading on the minimalism line is Ye's screams: unexpected and primal, they pierce the song abruptly, with beat changes coming and going in a manner never heard before. Personally, the tracks that were the least expected were my favorite: \"On Sight\" as an introduction is the most confused I've ever been when starting to listen to an album (I thought something was wrong with my iPod when it began). \"Hold My Liquor\" sounds ridiculous at first, but the longer it goes, the prettier it gets. \"Blood On The Leaves\" is my absolute favorite, with six minutes of him rapping/singing/wailing over a girl that he got pregnant, all on top of a sample of \"Strange Fruit,\" a song about lynching. This moment alone smacked me in the face and deftly declared that Mr. West sure had the guts, balls and genius to pull it off. It's bold, it's urgent, but it's most importantly, revolutionary.\u2026 Expand",

Kanye's lyrics are his most deranged on Yeezus, rhymes upon rhymes about how he feels as if he is a slave in in the entertainment industry and all the scum he encounters throughout his day to day life. Not to mention his view on previous relationships, something he's been singing about since 808's & Heartbreaks. If there's one complaint to be had about this record, it's that it loses replay value if you've listened to it at least 5 times, which is true for any album really, but more so if comparing it to other Kanye West records.\r All In All, Yeezus is about a black man on the brink of insanity, pushing through day to day demons that probably will never escape him, and also a fantastic, dark voyage of hip-hop music.

These ten songs bite and snarl like the dogs he samples \"Black Skinhead\" bringing to mind comparisons to aggressive hip hop groups such as Death Grips or Public Enemy. The sweeping varied orchestration of MBDTF and the profuse sampling of his earlier work is traded for hypnotic, pounding synths that evoke Suicide or Nine Inch Nails. The sounds are as aggressive as the lyrics that replace maudlin attempts at sincerity with blunt, violent sexual imagery and blatant egoism. Yet as disgusting and challenging this album can be, especially for those expecting MBDTF 2, it elicits a primal feeling in the listener and is much more rewarding on multiple listens then any of his previous works. It has just taken the place of my favorite album of the year so far, and itll be particularly hard to upset.\u2026 Expand",

He could have easily made another fantastic album like My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, but instead, he did his own thing and created my personal favorite album of all time.

(Fittingly, it\u2019s the winning line from a song about a perennial self-loather being on a first-name basis with Jesus Christ.)\r \u201cYeezus\u201d has already been branded as West\u2019s ugliest album, but he\u2019ll always be a populist at heart, incapable of releasing anything truly repulsive. For all of the charred melodies and serrated rhythms on \u201cYeezus,\u201d this is still luscious electronic music sculpted into elegant shapes that only signal threat. French dance music duo Daft Punk and studio sage Rick Rubin were called on to collaborate, helping West evoke hip-hop\u2019s icy, electro roots while echoing the sly, synthetic snarls of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails.\r There\u2019s still plenty of ugliness scribbled on West\u2019s lyric sheet. He plumbs the depths of his id like a knife scraping the bottom of the peanut butter jar. He turns civil-rights-era mantras into gross pillow talk that no human should ever utter in real life. He promises to get the club \u201cshaking like Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d\r \u201cBlack Skinhead\u201d crams all of this attitude into one dystopian, Gary Glitter-ish jock jam that would be perfect for the stadium scene finale of \u201cAkira,\u201d the legendary Japanese anime film that West adores. \u201cI keep it 300 like the Romans,\u201d he spits during the refrain, a boast that blurs fantasy and reality, Hollywood retina candy and Chicago gang violence. (\u201c300\u201d is slang for Chicago\u2019s Black Disciples street gang, as well as the title of a 2007 action flick in which ancient soldiers bathe one another in CGI blood.)\r Despite a handful of arresting quirks and kinks, the lyrics on \u201cYeezus\u201d are West\u2019s least refined and probably his least compelling. But they don\u2019t feel lazy so much as drunk on bitterness. After engineering something as magisterial as his 2010 opus \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\u201d this is West at his most wasted, stumbling through rubble.\r It\u2019s all over in about 40 minutes, instantly provoking questions about legacy. The last time West took a risk this great, with \u201c808s & Heartbreak,\u201d he taught hip-hop about the potency of vulnerability and ended up paving a four-lane highway for Drake, Kid Cudi, the Weeknd and Future. Will \u201cYeezus\u201d teach a rising generation of rap stars to melt poison from their frozen hearts?\r And how will the auteur himself reconcile the unholy mess he\u2019s been making? \u201cYeezus\u201d might blow our collective hair back for the summer, but West has to live with these tunes for the rest of his life. His girlfriend, Kim Kardashian, delivered a daughter Saturday. How do cynicism and self-obsession jibe with being a dad?\r In addition to keeping us thinking about him, West\u2019s music always keeps us thinking about the future. He\u2019s a visionary who\u2019s managed to tweak the serial rhythms that dictate so much of our pop culture diet. He doesn\u2019t do cliffhangers. He jumps off.\u2026 Expand",

The beat and flow just immediately catch your attention and drag you in.

The instrumental is astounding and the lyrics are among Ye's best. Same thing with New Slaves.\rI Am a God is boastful and obnoxious (HURRY UP WITH MY DAMN CROISSANTS!) but at the same time mesmerizing.\rOnly Kanye West can make a Chief Keef and Juston Vernon collaboration work. Hold My Liquor is that uber-catchy dark collaboration with three completely different hooks.\rI'm In It is twisted porn in music. The hook's singer is hysterical, and his verse is the fastest on the album but also hardest to understand with the accent. Kanye raps about eating Asian  with sweet and sour sauce, too, so that's relatively funny.\rBlood on the Leaves is everything good about 808s and Heartbreak, with Guilt Trip as its little cousin of a song.\rSend it Up is loud. Not in the instrumental or the rapping, but Mr. Rick Rubin did quite a lot to the hook's volume. Why? Makes no sense if you listen to the song, but OK.

What I can say is that Yeezus is the only rap album this year that I've heard where it genuinely caught me off-guard. There were multiple moments throughout the album where I said out loud \"he can't do that... you can't do that, right?\" But he did it. He would switch from one sample to the next, different tempo, no supporting beat, and then he would jump right back in to his flow with a new beat and sample behind himself.\rOne of Kanye's trademarks is his repetitious use of sampling. Each song is incredibly unique, from the primal, angry satire of Kanye backed with a huge drumline and Tarzan-ish screaming in Black Skinhead, to the industrial, heavily distorted opener On Sight. Bound 2 and Hold My Liquor were standout tracks for originality, although Blood on the Leaves and New Slaves were more recognized and also very inventive in their own right.\rNothing is in this album that doesn't belong in there, and that's a rare thing to say in the age of digital music recording. He went through ridiculous amounts of modifying, mixing, re-writing, and post-production over the course of this album, ultimately ending with the hiring of Rick Rubin the \"reducer\" less than three weeks before the album was due, to help over-see the final, drastic changes to the album.\rThis album gets a 9.5, but I am going to round down to a 9 because there were some lyrical moments that were distastefully sexual and not even in a clever way. If that album were without the track I'm In It, I might round up to a 10. Still, Kanye's style and artisanship are still leagues ahead of most rappers in the game today, and this album deserves a listen from anyone who claims to be tired of the \"same old same old.\"\u2026 Expand",

First off, Kanye's lyrics feel lazy and contain some bad punch lines on the majority of the tracks. Second I felt that some of the collaborations didn't add too much to the album, for example, I feel like Frank Ocean's feature on New Slaves feels phoned in, Chief Keef singing with auto tune on Can't Hold My Liqour isn't pleasant, and Kid Kudi's singing feature on Guilt Trip didn't really bring much to the track. Although this is not one of Kanye's best lyrical works, the album is augmented by some dark industrial/electronic flavored production, similar to the vein of underground acts, most notably Death Grips. The harsher, more abrasive, and minimalist production gives the album some nice dark overtones, and are strong pumping beats. I really enjoy the driving beats on the opening track, Black Skinhead, and I am a God. Another production highlight on this album is Blood On The Leaves which features a great sample of Nina Simone singing strange fruit. Additionally, the closing track has a more soulful vibe to it, which provides nice contrast. The atmosphere of the album is great, the tracks fit together well and its great to see Kanye try to use some new influences, because he could easily be making great music in his old style. I also was impressed with his social commentary on New Slaves.The best tracks on this album were Black Skin Head, New Slaves and Blood on the Leaves. I'd say my least favorite is I'm in it. This album would have been better if Kanye had written better lyrics and put more time into it to refine it more. He was going somewhere great with this, however he ruined some of the vibe with too many trashy punch lines(although some of it is forgivable taking into account that the album's name is Yeezus and Kanye's ego is a part of his music). I really did enjoy this album, I would like to give it a higher score but the issues are gonna bring it down a bit.  I would highly recommend checking out Death Grips who have even more gritty production and have horrifyingly disgusting lyrics.\u2026 Expand",

This album isn't an easy listen and it wont click the first time you hear it, it takes perseverance and time to start to like this album, but after a few listens you will really start to see the genius of 'Yeezus'.\u2026 Expand",

As for the lyrics, typical Kanye lyrics. Blood on the Leaves is a song that seems to not have made it on to Kanye's 808s & Heartbreak, but it's still a good song, though it does feel out of place on Yeezus. Then there's Guilt Trip, featuring Kid Cudi. Another song that seems to not have made it onto 808s & HB, but this one is just bad. It feels like a song just put there to add a song and fill up some space. Kanye could have at least made us another filler song, better than the Guilt Trip. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase, but don't think Yeezus lived up to the hype.\u2026 Expand",

I do not love it, because I want to feel safe in this knowledge. I do not love it, but I like it very much.\r Highlights:\rBlack Skinhead  The screaming. Slow build. Chugging beat. Powerful, delectable angsty goodness.\rBlood On The Leaves  Reminiscent, intense, fearful. Definitely a personal highlight. Something very \"808's\" about it.\rBound 2  A warm, fuzzy send off that melts the ice that has coated the prior 9 tracks.\r Lower Points:\rI'm In It  Not too fond of the sampling. It feels predictable, almost tacky.\rGuilt Trip  I feel as though something went wrong with this one. Kinda rushed lyrically. I feel quite bad about that too, because Kid Cudi does a fine job towards the end. I kind of wish I liked it.\u2026 Expand",

On \"Guilt Trip\" he even went further to introduce 8-bit bass synthesizer. The samples are horrible too, sampling screwed up a potentially nice track like \"Bound 2\".\r Kanye West's lyrics are the most narcissist, and it's sad because other than \"New Slaves\",  the whole album revolves around  \"Screw your music, I go home to bang Kim Kardashian every night\" (\"I am a God\" is a proof)\r Still I find the track \"Blood on The Leaves\" to be a cool track, the Nina Simone sample created a great amp along the dirty-brass and piano melodies. \"Send it Up\" might be rocking clubs within a few months probably  the drum-line in \"Black Skinhead\" is nice.

Perhaps \u201cBlack Skinhead\u201d is supposed to pick up where \u2018Power\u2019 left off, delineating the aftermath and hangover of a power trip. The metaphor could be stretched even further to foster the idea of Kanye having some sort of allegorical attraction to the DC superhero Batman. Being a \u201cdark knight\u201d or being seen as a vigilante or bad guy, when only trying to do good. Kanye has been showing up to recent performances wearing masks and elaborate costumes going on about how he \u201cisn\u2019t a celebrity.\u201d He is the hero for music and culture in a similar way Batman is a hero for Gotham City. The media may claim the perspective of both as something that should encourage hate, they are \u201cThe hero the city deserves, but not the one it needs right now.\u201d At track number three is the highly controversial \u2018I Am a God\u2019 which has Kanye basking in all the negativity he\u2019s experienced  the hate received for everything from his music to his fashion  and proclaims himself to be a God over a barrage of synths, howls and bass.

Good artists have a tendency to stick to a tried & tested formula which, after a while, becomes uninteresting, this is why so many musicians' best albums happen to be their debut album  e.g. 50 Cent, Nas, Pharcyde, Eminem, The Strokes etc. The truly GREAT artists are the ones that can continue to bring something NEW to the table  e.g. The Roots, OutKast, Radiohead, Pink Floyd  Kanye West belongs in this list.\r Love him or hate him, he's an innovator with balls, and that's something you very, very rarely find in mainstream music.\u2026 Expand",

Kanye does not make music for the fans of Radio Hip-Hop nor for the common easy going listener. And melodically, the album plays on the notions of dichotomy, from uncomfortable screechy synths to truly harmonious echoes of beauty. He is continually subverting a society in which typical every day norms are replaced by the 'Black Skinhead'. This prevalent undertone is unfortunately disguised by Kanye's array of misogynistic and perhaps unattractive verse.\rHowever, this album is alone, remarkably Kanye is attempting to catalyze a progression in music, 'again'. The original controversial reception of 80s & Heartbreaks has now morphed into an appreciation for what we hear every day. In this album Kanye West once again stamps on the fence surrounding our microcosm of normal music and he takes full credit for this. He is the square peg in a round hole.\u2026 Expand",

Not a bad message, if it wasn't so hypocritical. Kanye West, or rather the Louis Vuitton Don (his old moniker) himself is a corporation, with ties to Nike via his Air Yeezus lines as well as his own clothing companies. He has crafted a song entirely aimed at exposing the ills of capitalism, and yet, he hasn't the hindsight to look into his own life and see that the clothing lines he either supports, endorses or manufactures are largely made in sweatshops. While this is just one song that i find trouble with, the confusing messages/themes run rampant throughout this album. The music is top notch, well produced, and finely crafted, something that we have all come to expect from Kanye. However, I cannot get passed the lyrics on this one.\u2026 Expand",

The album isn't terrible, 'New Slaves' and 'Black Skinhead' prove he still has it, and the production is solid throughout. Kanye has the potential to be hailed as a legend, however this album will only serve to weaken his catalogue and as a result his claim to that throne\u2026 Expand",

In my opinion when it comes to the lyrics, Born Sinner is the winner of the two by far, on Yeezus it felt kinda lazy with it but he sure had his moments at times. Not Ye's best tough. Production wise Yeezus has more flavour to it, more harder bass and production. Either you love the production of Yeezus or you simply dislike it. I'm a huge Kanye fan but to me the lyrics didn't to me or the production really well. Yeezus is good, great in it's five first tracks. And Black Skinhead is so far one of the year's best with New Slaves. Born Sinner.. too me, is fantastic. He's rhymes are really well put-together and he's flow switches up good and dosen't get boring. 18th June is a great day in Hip Hop. Let's welcome \"the newer\" faces, if J. Cole's albums are at least as good as Born Sinner then he sure is going to do ous well in the future. And thank you Mr. West for keeping Hip Hop exciting. Ps. MBDTF is one of my fave.\u2026 Expand",

Yikes is good despite some terrible lyrics, and Violent Crimes throws a curveball by ending a fairly reprehensible album (lyrically) on a very sentimental note. More lows than highs in terms of Kanye's vocals and lyrical content, but the production saves this album from being a complete disaster.\r It just doesn't stack up to his other three albums this decade. Where Daytona doesn't waste a minute of its short run time, Ye does just that with two exceptions. These songs feel undercooked, and not because of the spare production, which is one of its saving graces.\u2026 Expand",

This also shouldn't come as a surprise, and maybe it's part of a so called concept, since the album reportedly was made in just a month.\rThere are plenty of half-baked ideas and lazy lyrics on here, so one would wish that West for once wouldn't have done justice to his self-imposed deadline (a deadline he'd given himself before even starting on the album).\rOn the other hand, it's also fascinating to look at this project (can you call this an album?) as the result of a single month, a single, troubled point in time in Wests life and career. He addresses his mental health, his family and the impact his behaviour had on them in standout tracks such as the beautiful \"Wouldn't leave\".\rUnfortunately, there are also plenty of cringeworthy Kanye West lyrics on here. His handling of the TMZ situation seems childish and doesn't add anything useful to the discussion, nor is it funny. It makes the listener feel glad that West doesn't dwell on the whole Trump situation that much. There's also a track about infidelity, which thematically seems a bit ouf of place, as do the bars about drugs on \"Yikes\".\rHis lyrics on the closer \"Violent Crimes\", which is beautifully produced, are heartfelt, but also old-fashioned in their \"I-respect-women-now-that-I-have-a-daughter\" sentiments. Implying that all men are monsters and his daughter needs protection doesn't help either. Still, it seems very genuine. The track features 070 Shake, a GOOD Music newcomer who also appears on \"Ghost Town\", another standout track, mostly due to her performance.\rOther features include Kid Cudi, Ty Dolla Sign, John Legend, Jeremih, Charlie WIlson and PARTYNEXTDOOR, who delivers a fantastic vocal performance on \"Wouldn't Leave\".\rThe opening track is also very interesting: West displays murder fantasies, and it's not quite clear who they're aimed at (his wife? himself?). He delivers a lengthy monologue over a gourgeous, minimalistic piece of production, before he actually starts rapping and the beat switches.\rSome might say that this unfocused nature of the lyrics, as well as the minimalistic and unfinished production actually play into the theme of the album. Kanye seems to embrace his fragile mental state, he proclaims his bipolar-disorder, which he was supposedly diagnosed with, as his \"super power\". Others might say that you can't pass off short and unfinished work as a \"concept\".\rThe truth is probably somewhere in the middle, as \"ye\" brings us all the highs and lows we've come to expect from Kanye West in recent years. It features some very beautiful and humane moments, and the production is mostly very good, but the whole thing seems flushed out to quick. The \"short album\" thing doesn't work as well as it did with Pusha T's razor-sharp \"DAYTONA\", and \"ye\", despite it's moments of past greatness, feels like it's just too little, too late.\u2026 Expand",

Sample heavy, Ye's rich production shines on glorious tracks like Ghost Town, where Kid Cudi and Mike Dean deliver one of Kanye's best-ever tracks. The entire album has multiple elements: the modern trap of TLOP (2016), choirs and Mike Dean guitar of MBDTF (2010), rich synths of 808s (2008) and LR (2005). Lyrically, this project is stronger and more introspective than The Life of Pablo. Ye has moments of brilliance where Kanye recaps his struggles with addiction and bipolar disorder, calling it his \"superpower\". On the flip-side, Ye also has a few cringy moments, most notably being Kanye's second verse on \"All Mine.\" I'm afraid that Kanye's jarring political comments in the recent months might skew some reviews, but make no mistake, Kanye has given us a very solid album.

Thankfully this album takes ideas from 2016s \"Ultralight Beam\" and is much more focused on production guest spots and that while sonically pleasing makes this a bit disappointing to fans of Wests rapping skills there is some bars on this album that are unbelievably pleasing such as the half sung half rapped verses of \"ghost town\" that is reminiscent of bound 2 production wise or \"violent crimes\" sincere verses about West being worried about his daughter. This album is a mixed bag that truly has amazing moments but the lackluster rapping truly hinders this album I would've liked them to be cut and just be sung for most of this album. I truly think this album had amazing potentially I hope this album is remixed and mastered again like the life of Pablo however in it's current state songs like \"yikes\" and \"all mine\" have awful verses with no delivery and it dosent have the charisma or bravado of West's previous works.\u2026 Expand",

I went into this album with low expectations after the mess of \"Ye vs. The People\" and was expecting a crazy show of political songs. But he really exceeded my expectations more than I could ever expect. You can tell something has changed within him since his breakdown and it was a somewhat revival of what he talks about. he goes from the crazy rambling Kanye on The Life of Pablo to a thought provoking Kanye that is facing his depression and calling it a superpower so it doesn't take over him. Although there are still crazy lyrics, this has to be one of his most thoughtful records he's made in years. This truly does sound like the future of Kanye and I'm alright with that. The producing is also so much better than the mess of Pablo and it all comes together in a amazing way. I will always defend his music and this album is the ulitmate reason why I will. It's great to see him like this and it's reasons like these that I am giving it a perfect 10. Keep it up!\u2026 Expand",

To sum it up, the first half of the record exhibits Kanye's manic part of his psyche, where he has his ego, suicidality, and sexuality unapologetically on display. The remaining 4 songs show his journey to freedom from his demons through his wife and kids, ending with Kanye's transformation from an egomaniacal, misogynistic celebrity to a loving, caring father who worries a lot about his kids and loves and appreciates his wife. Very wholesome vibes.\r All of this is accomplished in under 24 minutes, all while delivering some of Kanye's greatest tracks of all time and most personal verses, wrapped up in a neat bow with the immaculate production and creativity displayed throughout the project. The only small nitpick I have is that the instrumentation is a bit bare in the first half of All Mine, which makes it just slightly underwhelming and lacking in impact in that specific part. Nonetheless, this is undoubtedly one of Kanye's best albums to date, and deserves much more attention and love from fans and audiences in general.\r 9/10\u2026 Expand",

I do enjoy the risk that he took on some of the songs.\r The other tracks on the album are filled with strong and funny moments. I think the best tracks on this album are the opening and closing tracks. Also, the track with Kid Cudi gives us a sample on how the album Kid See Ghost will sound. Looking forward to listening to more tracks produced by Kanye. I think the album is well-written but also felt like some moments on this album is so cringy. Some of the lines are so wack while the other is strong. This is a hard project to review because I am still confused about it. It's well-produced but it's not his best, it's probably his worst.\r I think the real highlight of this album is 070 Shake.

Yet while he might be talking about serious issues, I feel like he barely scratches the surface.

The content of this song is good, but sonically it sounds the same as the stuff he was doing on \u201cThe Life Of Pablo\u201d which I wasn't a fan of.\r'All Mine' is probably the worst song on the album with its terrible chorus and its ridiculous lyrics.\r'Wouldn't Leave' was another track where I thought he barely scratched the surface of anything serious. He brings up the issues we want him to talk about, but that's it, he doesn't expand on them whatsoever.\rKanye also sounded like he was reflecting all the mistakes he's done and seems to be brushing them off like \u201cOh, well Kim didn't leave me so I cant be in the wrong.\u201d\r'Ghost Town' is by far my favorite track on the album.  Kid Cudi and 070 Shake did such great jobs with their features, Kanye himself sounds really good as well. This song was grand, detailed and everything you would expect from a Kanye West made song and was a major stand out on the album.\r'Violent Crimes' is the last track. Where he talks about being a dad and the worries he has with his daughters growing up. All around great song.\r While I think this is one of Kanye's most personal albums,  I don't think he wasn't able to expand on these topics well enough for me to feel anything.

Besides the first two songs, the album does not have any of the compelling compositions that created obscure nuances which made him such an artistic genius. 'wouldn't leave', 'all mine', and 'violent crimes' are especially bad.

With a 23 minute long album, I think Kanye should have not wasted any time with rants or spoken lyrics, however, skipped straight to the bars. The rnb and soul feel to the album was excellent. Despite this, some tracks were not fully executed especially the first track, where he is speaking for around a minute. I'd understand skits and interludes in an album like TLOP, but this was a too short album for time to be wasted. In my opinion, this is one of Kanye's lesser greater albums, but in saying that it is still an amazing album compared to other rap albums. I just think Kanye put too much focus in Daytona to worry about his own album, but that is what all great producer's do like Dr. Dre, who instead of advancing his career made music for the likes of 50 cent and Eminem. Therefore, this album for me would be a 78 which would round up to an 8 out of 10. To Kanye's standards the album was not too great, but compared to other hip hop albums, it was an excellent project and I am comparing this to other hip hop albums. Strewth.\u2026 Expand",

The problem is, no amount of incredible sampling can save this album from the fact that it sounds incredibly half-assed. Sure, Kanye is known for his rough-around-the-edges artistry, a factor that works to his benefit on albums like 'The Life of Pablo.' The difference, however, is that on albums like 'TLOP,' this roughness sounds like it stems from a thirst and ambition to create something great, a thirst that can never be quenched; on 'Ye,' it sounds like Kanye got cocky and imposed this one-month deadline on himself for the sole purpose of proving to his ego that he could create an album in such a short time span. It is an impressive feat indeed - but that alone does not make this album a good one. Lyrically, it's easily his weakest album - and it's not close. There are the typical Kanye-isms we all crave, but they are surrounded by lines and lines of cheesy, superficial lyrics that don't come close to the level we expect from the Kanye we all have come to know and love. While the production and sampling are incredible as per usual, the songs suffer from a blatant and painful brevity. On Kanye's first GOOD Music project of the summer - Pusha-T's 'Daytona' - for example, the songs were cohesive and nuanced enough that the album, just seven tracks in length, feels MUCH longer than its 21-minute run time, in a great way. 'Ye' feels like it's over in 15 minutes, and leaves the listener with much to be desired - not in the sense of wanting more, but more so wishing for a do-over. In the end, I can't help but feel that, just maybe, we've arrived at the point in Kanye's career where so much new ground has been tread that there simply is not much more left to tread. I hope to God I'm wrong - and if there's any one person who can prove it and come back from a place like that, it's Kanye. One thing is for certain, though - 'Ye' the first Kanye album we did not need. (5.2/10)\u2026 Expand",

Coming right off the biggest controversy and public image nightmare of his career its no surprise reviewers don't give this a chance. Only time will tell how good this is. Kanye gives us 7 beautiful tracks with near zero flaws about mental illness and family. It's a spiritual awakening of sorts and an extremely important album for kanye himself. Feels like t's made for himself and real fans more than for the publics acceptance like he did for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Easily the most personal record he's done, it can be an emotional listen for kanye fans.\r The first 3 tracks are manic and all over the place. Adopting Yeezus and Pablo style personas and sound on mental health, loneliness, ego, lust, and depression. \"I Thought About Killing You\" is striking right off the bat talking about his ego and possible bi polar reference then has a few words for his haters and struggling friendships. \"Yikes\" is a full on manic episode about mental health, and referencing his \"breakthrough.\" \"All Mine\" is the catchiest song sounding like it could've been on Life Of Pablo with Kanye throwing comical bars on social commentary and sex. \"Wouldn't Leave\" separates the album with an apology dedicated to Kim. It seems so personal to the point it felt no one else but her was supposed to hear it. The last 3 tracks change tone completely, they feel nostalgic and soulful; songs about family and redemption. No Mistakes is classic kanye straight outta 2007. Ghost Town is the most beautiful track on the album, with an innovative sound mixing 60s pop and pete rock. Violent Crimes ends it with a track dedicated to his daughter, personal favorite.\r My only complaint is i wish it was 11 or 12 songs! I believe the reception would've changed so much if that were the case. The other Wyoming projects produced from Kanye have a very big production that the albums feel full. This is the only one that is raw and stripped down so i do think that effects the 7 tracks feeling incomplete in a way. Yeezy season and Good Fridays are back!\u2026 Expand",

Its kinda like poetry. When he starts rapping its not bad but I didn't care for it. He has a few nice lines but that's it. I just don't think its a song so its probably my least favorite in the album.\r \"Yikes\"\rPretty good song. Lots of good lines. I personally don't care for it too much but I think its good overall. I could see others enjoying it.\r \"All Mine\"\rThe best song in the album in my opinion. I like the beat and flow. Would recommend %100.\r \"Wouldn't Leave\"\rIt's a song about Kanye's personal life. He is saying how he knew Kim wouldn't leave even though he has been controversial. The song itself isn't bad. I like it a bit less than \"Yikes\" because there are parts that ruin the flow.\r \"No Mistakes\"\rI don't like this one. I think he is talking about Kim again but there is no substance to it. My second least favorite song in the album.\r \"Ghost Town\"\rI think this is a good song. Its got a good flow. Not my favorite but its one of the good songs.\r \"Violent Crimes\"\rThis is a really good song. Its my second favorite. It's Kanye talking about his kids and worrying about guys objectifying them. There is one part at the very end that ruins it. It's just talking and that sucks if its on a big play-list because it ruins the flow. The song is still really good.\r So in conclusion.

Kicking off with \"I Thought About Killing You\", where Ye discusses his thoughts of taking his own life, his bipolar. The production on this track, and all the others as well, is unique and makes the album much more interesting, greatly adding to the tone each song gives off. He speaks the first half of the track, sort of thinking out loud, towards the end of which he says he should \"Say something good so it doesn't come off bad\" and that if he was trying to \"relate it to more people i would say I'm struggling with loving myself, but thats not the case\". This is followed by Yikes, where Kanye addresses his God complex as well as the thoughts in his head. He talks about the controversy he's created leading up toe release. For classic Ye fans, this is probably the only song that will be enjoyable, which is a big thing with this album, the tracks are more lyrical and emotionally driven than they are driven to be these Game Changing Kanye BANGERZ that he has been know to drop throughout his career. All Mine is a simple beat, great production, for the most part lyrics that don't fit the theme of the album, all around decent track. On Wouldn't Leave Ye starts to talk more about controversies and what this negative attention has done to him and his family. He's kind of saying on the chorus he knew the people that saw these and would get angry at him for saying these things would not go away, would still listen to him and the record. On No Mistakes he seems to have this happier, more carefree attitude that he hasn't had the rest of the record. He seems more content and accepting of what gets fired at him. Following that is Ghost Town which is easily going to be one of the best singles of the year. He talks about pretty much everything here, from the controversies to to his bipolar, and 070 Shake's verse at the end about \"nothing hurting anymore\" closes out the track very very nicely. Closing out the record we have Violent Crimes where Kanye talks about being savage and ruthless until a child come along. Talking about people being crazy until their daughter comes into world and becoming protective of their kid, telling her not to \"grow up in a hurry\". The album closes out with a voicemail from Nicki Minaj, spitting a couple lines from earlier in Kanye's verse, asking him to make sure the fans hear it.\r Overall the album is an emotional journey, the thing as a whole after a couple listens can even be a little tear jerking. The production, as i said previously is really really good, original, not like much I've heard this year at least. Kanye's voice, the way he portrays his emotions, he sounds beat down, broken, listening closely you can feel the raw emotions he has throughout. Even his features compliment the tones on each track, Cudi and shake on Ghost Town especially, as well as everyone on Violent Crimes. I personally believe that eventually people will begin to warm up to this record and realize this is one of Ye's best, if not the best thing he's put out to date. This easily going to be in my Top 10 of the year and overall a very strong 9/10.\u2026 Expand",

Last Call is one of the better outros of the year even though it's a copy of Kanye's. The production is undeniably solid throughout and 6ix has again showed that he meshes so well with Logic.

After the commercial success of The Incredible True Story, he officially split from the underground and came out with a far more commercialized project in Everybody, something that ended up as merely decent when compared to his overwhelming discography. His exposure has lead to universal recognition and admiration, and even though the lead single was an awkward public service announcement on suicide...\r (Who can relate? Whoo!!!)\r ...he still had plenty of gain. Now comes YSIV, the final installment of a nostalgic Young Sinatra series and the continuation of a new period. First of all, the production in this album in general is outstanding. It started as a tribute to boom-bap, and it ended up implementing an enjoyable hybrid of superb 90's beats with relevant messages. Thank You is the victory lap for Logic, and Everybody Dies is the fast-paced homage to his older works, where he raps about his comeuppance in an onimous and shadow-lurking sound. Wu-Tang Forever was a very enjoyable track involving the reunion of the Wu-Tang Clan, but it was a little awkward hearing each member try to enter a modern Logic beat. Legacy is in my opinion a perfectly crafted rap song courtesy of Logic, where he ponders a frightening and a pessimistic future over a set of guitar strums and the distant female vocals that beautifully mix together to create an emotional roller-coaster ride of a track. It closes out strong with the title track integrating many samples including Nas' Life's a B****, closing out with a shoutout to the late Mac Miller.\r It delivered on plenty on aspects, so much so that it is impossible to call him out on how \"corny\" he is. Aside from plenty of filler verses and some awkward moments in the album, it well exceeded my standards. Give the entire album a try, because it doesn't hurt to take something away from Logic's brilliance.\u2026 Expand",

This is quite a feat for an artist like Logic, but in the end it really worked out, bringing up the album's value by a lot.  The only thing that was slightly disappointing was that Jaden Smith's part was very short and he didn't actually go any further than just saying one sentence.  Furthermore, Logic didn't take the perfect chance to use Jaden in a better way and the whole Iconic track ended up seeming like a ripoff of Jaden's Icon track.  However, aside from all that, the album should be considered a success, because it was in fact, that.\u2026 Expand",

Excluding The Capeman's self limiting concept, Paul Simon's works have grown to be more and more Spiritual since the mid-80's (not that he wasn't so before, just moreso after then), and it really works to his advantage here, as the songsmithing and depth of subject help to invigorate what is a more laid back work sonically speaking.

After all, it was the word her late husband first spied in that magnifying glass after climbing that storied ladder in that London art museum many years ago, causing him to refocus his love to this avant garde artist. Unfortunately, it doesn't answer the question as to whether this a good album. It isn't. It sucks. As for Yoko being a witch, most Beatlemaniacs would concur with that assessment. Me, I don't have a problem with her attempting to be something she most assuredly is not, and that is talented. I do have a problem with those who fawn over her, more out of respect for her late husband and the ordeal she's gone through dealing with his murder, I'll wager. If it wasn't for John Lennon, well, think Kevin Federline without Brittany Spears. If cat-scratch vocals and simple melodies are your cup of tea, then by all means, check her out. I'll revisit the Plastic Ono Band if I want to hear anything with her name attached to it. At least there she knew her musical place - silent by her husband's side.
