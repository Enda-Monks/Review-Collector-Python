Especially with the addition of Carl and Bo, the Jacket is reaching into new ground. They have a truly Zeppelin-esque approach to the rock scene: take what you like, and make it your own, in a way that nobody's done it before. Who would've thought that \"I Needed It Most\" would have preceded \"Phone Went West\" on At Dawn, and now the tracklisting has \"Off the Record\" followed by \"Into the Woods.\" A rock-reggae trippy jam session followed by a beautiful demented circus waltz. And the thing is, it works. The album is encapsulating, and it ends as beautifully as it starts. Where we find outrselves thrown in with a mysteriously simple dance groove, we find the album closed with truly \"sad, mysterious dance music.\" Amidst the drum and bass groove, Jim sings in a gentle, subdued manner on \"Dondante,\" but builds and builds until you find that you're singing along with the guitar solo and get torn in two by the chorus. \"You had me worried...\" Simply reading the words cannot in any way, shape, or form express the sheer distress and frustration of this song. There is a power in this music, and it's one that you will rarely find in the music scene today. I challenge to put on headphones and close your eyes and listen to \"Dandante\" and not feel moved. I don't care if you hate Jim's voice, or listen to nothing but Slayer - this song will move with an emotional force that few bands today even come close to comprehending. And Jim, through \"Dondante\" and previous releases like \"Steam Engine\" and \"The Bear,\" has found a language that transcens mere vowels and consonants, but on a level of pure emotion.\u2026 Expand",

My point is this: yes MMJ had a good cross over album, and yes it is listenable, but what we lose are the ragged edges. There is beauty in imperfection. Corporate sound is clean, too clean so it can be mass marketed, mass consumed. This will be MMJ's best selling album, but it will never break my heart like At Dawn or even Tennessee Fire.\u2026 Expand",

Either that or they grew up in the 70's and are stuck there and anything after that has been a \"copy cat\". It is true that MMJ borrows alot from 70's rock. In fact many groups borrow from 70's and 80's music nowadays, but few can take the music they love, add their own flair and pull it off. MMJ is one of the few. This CD is an instant classic and will be one of the revered recordings of this decade. The reverb is still persent, but not as glaring in previous efforts, and the newly revamped band rocks out, especially on Anytime and What a Wonderful Man. There are a couple of weaker tracks on the CD, but are overshadowed by the highlights like Gideon and Anytime. MMJ uses keyboards more often and effectively than peviously and the result is a more well rounded sound on two of my personal favorite tracks It Beats 4 U and Wordless Chorus. The CD closes with the epic Dondante. As a sidenote, I caught MMJ at the Avalon in Boston, and they were just as good as on Okonokos. I recommend seing them soon before they headline Amphiteaters. MMJ truly is a great American rock Band.\u2026 Expand",

This is a sound, and atmosphere, that is totally newWhile I still loved and enjoyed this album, it was a project, sound and style that really threw me off on my first few listens, but grew on me, quite a lot, as time and my listening continued. I was going into this project expecting a sound like the 'Mixtape Denzel Curry' I fell in love with listening to, and still do absolutely love. This is a sound, and atmosphere, that is totally new and different for Denzel. Not only are the lyrics, stories and references back to his home city of Miami, Florida, very admirable, but also sonically, Denzel reached into another new direction and sound for this project. This total Miami sound and vibe he attacks for the first time is great for Denzel and honestly sounds fantastic. Tracks like 'P.A.T,' are a callback and a step forward for the loud, noisy and blaring sound that Denzel has perfected, and showed off that he's great at creating throughout his career, and it's very awe-inspiring to hear Denzel pushing this sound forward, once again. Also finally, 'P.A.T' is a fantastic closing track for this project, (like every one of Curry's closing tracks on his projects) and this makes me believe the man could do no wrong, and a very damn great job as a lead singer in a Rock or Metal band (please go through with that Denzel, I can only wish for that as of now), and over the years his' tracks like P.A.T, Narcotics and his' Bulls on Parade cover (and technically a song remix, with him including Verse 3 from his song 'SIRENS | Z1RENZ,' toward the conclusion of the song) are all great examples of how great Denzel sounds with a loud, deafening, scream while delivering his, or anyone's lyrics. Denzel truly is a generational talent, and one that has yet to release a bad project, whether it be a mixtape, EP or album. While I do not believe he is the best rapper currently creating the genre of music, he is very damn close, skill wise and 'project success/positivity wise' to the man who is the best rapper as of right now and of this generation, Kendrick Lamar, and if he continues on with the great work he's been creating since 2011, many more listeners will understand and agree with that statement. Does his unique, great sounding and distinct delivery work and sound good to all listeners? No. Does everyone who understands hip hop music and listens or critiques music understand, love and or see the great traits that Denzel brings to the hip hop landscape? Absolutely. Denzel's typical loud sound does not fit the ears of all listeners, but all of the individuals who understand music, and what makes music great are very in touch with Denzel and his music, sound and what makes him a fantastic rapper to get behind, watch climb up the ladder that is hip hop, and keep a close eye on as he continues his journey toward becoming universally known, as the best rapper, or simply just, artist, in 'the game,'  or just the field of music at the moment. This project is scarily one of Denzel's best and while it is not 'something big,' as Denzel would say and did say, it still is a  of great music and a short project that since release, I have listened to a large number of times.\u2026 Expand",

He put a lot of time and effort into Taboo and not every album needs to be a masterpiece. Besides, the bangers is what initially got me onto him when I first heard \"Zone 3\" from Nostalgic 64. The easy comparison for this is Vince Staple's FM! from last year, but this is better than that simply because the production is better and Denzel fleshed out his songs more. The only exception to that is obviously the \"Bushy B Interlude\" that sounds like it had the potential to be an incredible, but then its just cut short. However, the biggest problem with this album is how inconsistent it is. Some of the songs, while there's not necessarily anything bad about them, just don't do much for me like \"Automatic\" and \"Carolmart\". Some of the features also stand out like a sore thumb. \"Wish\" is a great song with a catchy hook and a killer first verse from Denzel and then Kiddo Marv comes in and really drops the ball. The only two songs that are just straight up bad songs are Shake 88 and P.A.T., both with terrible features and premises that just don't do anything for me. The highlights on this album are essentially the entire first half. It's just banger after banger with incredible production and great energy and songwriting by Denzel. Its heavy on the bass and filled to the brim with sounds, never leaving any space empty. The only exception to that is Speedboat which is more stripped back consisting of mostly darker sounding piano, but Denzel still brings as much energy as any of the songs and creates a really catchy hook. I do want to point out how good he has gotten at choruses, even better than Taboo. The first 6 songs on this are all really catchy and fun songs. His singing even doesn't sound half-bad on \"ZUU\" and \"Wish\" which is something that I know bothered people before. This album is just really disjointed with the first half being damn near perfect and the second half being completely disposable. I ended up giving it 4 stars because the good outweighs the bad in my eyes but man, if he had kept working on this more and kept up the quality on the first half he could have surpassed even his last album.\u2026 Expand",

SZA has no problem letting you know which feelings she's singing about, but I think she needs a little work on how she's expressing them through her singing. Also, the production needs to help here a little more, not saying the production is not class enough, but sometimes I feel that it either overshadows here, o leaves her all alone, walking on a thin line. The featurings on this album leave me wanting more, specially the Isaiah Rashad and Chance The Rapper ones, which leads me to think, SZA needs to work on making her solo stuff much more powerful and consistent. At the end of the day, I'm looking forward to her next project, wishing no more than improvement and endurance.\u2026 Expand",
